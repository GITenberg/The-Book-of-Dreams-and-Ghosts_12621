description: 'It has been known for some time that Mr. Lang has added ghosts to his
  hobbies. In the volume before us, " The Book of Dreams and Ghosts,'''' Mr. Lang
  offers a large collection of ghost stories old and new, and his opinions on "appearances."
  As far as we can gather Mr. Lang''s attitude from these pages, which have much of
  the vagueness of expression that goes with memoirs of the supernatural, he disbelieves
  in traditional ghosts, the ghosts that do things-but wishes it were otherwise. Like
  all persons of poetical or romantic temperament, he would prefer to believe in them.
  They would make life so much more interesting and exciting. This book is annotated
  with a rare extensive biographical sketch of the author, Andrew Lang, written by
  Sir Edmund Gosse, CB, a contemporary poet and writer. From the contents: The Dog
  Fanti Mark Twain''s Story The Pig In The Dining-Room The Mignonette The Lost Cheque
  The Ducks'' Eggs The Lost Key The Lost Securities The Arrears Of Teind The Two Curmas
  The Assyrian Priest The Knot In The Shutter Queen Mary''s Jewels The Deathbed Dream
  Of Mr. Perceval''s Murder The Rattlesnake The Red Lamp The Scar In The Moustache

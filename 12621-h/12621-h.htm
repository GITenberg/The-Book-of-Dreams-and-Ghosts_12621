<h1>THE BOOK OF DREAMS AND GHOSTS</h1>
<h2>PREFACE TO THE NEW IMPRESSION</h2>
<p>Since the first edition of this book appeared (1897) a considerable
number of new and startling ghost stories, British, Foreign and Colonial,
not yet published, have reached me.&nbsp; Second Sight abounds.&nbsp;
Crystal Gazing has also advanced in popularity.&nbsp; For a singular
series of such visions, in which distant persons and places, unknown
to the gazer, were correctly described by her, I may refer to my book,
<i>The Making of Religion</i> (1898).&nbsp; A memorial stone has been
erected on the scene of the story called &ldquo;The Foul Fords&rdquo;
(p. 269), so that tale is likely to endure in tradition.</p>
<p><i>July</i>, 1899.</p>
<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
<p>The chief purpose of this book is, if fortune helps, to entertain
people interested in the kind of narratives here collected.&nbsp; For
the sake of orderly arrangement, the stories are classed in different
grades, as they advance from the normal and familiar to the undeniably
startling.&nbsp; At the same time an account of the current theories
of Apparitions is offered, in language as free from technicalities as
possible.&nbsp; According to modern opinion every &ldquo;ghost&rdquo;
is a &ldquo;hallucination,&rdquo; a false perception, the perception
of something which is not present.</p>
<p>It has not been thought necessary to discuss the psychological and
physiological processes involved in perception, real or false.&nbsp;
Every &ldquo;hallucination&rdquo; is a perception, &ldquo;as good and
true a sensation as if there were a real object there.&nbsp; The object
happens <i>not</i> to be there, that is all.&rdquo; <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a">{0a}</a>&nbsp;
We are not here concerned with the visions of insanity, delirium, drugs,
drink, remorse, or anxiety, but with &ldquo;sporadic cases of hallucination,
visiting people only once in a lifetime, which seems to be by far the
most frequent type&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;These,&rdquo; says Mr. James,
&ldquo;are on any theory hard to understand in detail.&nbsp; They are
often extraordinarily complete; and the fact that many of them are reported
as <i>veridical</i>, that is, as coinciding with real events, such as
accidents, deaths, etc., of the persons seen, is an additional complication
of the phenomenon.&rdquo; <a name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b">{0b}</a>&nbsp;
A ghost, if seen, is undeniably so far a &ldquo;hallucination&rdquo;
that it gives the impression of the presence of a real person, in flesh,
blood, and usually clothes.&nbsp; No such person in flesh, blood, and
clothes, is actually there.&nbsp; So far, at least, every ghost is a
hallucination, &ldquo;<i>that</i>&rdquo; in the language of Captain
Cuttle, &ldquo;you may lay to,&rdquo; without offending science, religion,
or common-sense.&nbsp; And that, in brief, is the modern doctrine of
ghosts.</p>
<p>The old doctrine of &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; regarded them as actual
&ldquo;spirits&rdquo; of the living or the dead, freed from the flesh
or from the grave.&nbsp; This view, whatever else may be said for it,
represents the simple philosophy of the savage, which may be correct
or erroneous.&nbsp; About the time of the Reformation, writers, especially
Protestant writers, preferred to look on apparitions as the work of
deceitful devils, who masqueraded in the aspect of the dead or living,
or made up phantasms out of &ldquo;compressed air&rdquo;.&nbsp; The
common-sense of the eighteenth century dismissed all apparitions as
&ldquo;dreams&rdquo; or hoaxes, or illusions caused by real objects
misinterpreted, such as rats, cats, white posts, maniacs at large, sleep-walkers,
thieves, and so forth.&nbsp; Modern science, when it admits the possibility
of occasional hallucinations in the sane and healthy, also admits, of
course, the existence of apparitions.&nbsp; These, for our purposes,
are hallucinatory appearances occurring in the experience of people
healthy and sane.&nbsp; The difficulty begins when we ask whether these
appearances ever have any provoking mental cause outside the minds of
the people who experience them&mdash;any cause arising in the minds
of others, alive or dead.&nbsp; This is a question which orthodox psychology
does not approach, standing aside from any evidence which may be produced.</p>
<p>This book does not pretend to be a convincing, but merely an illustrative
collection of evidence.&nbsp; It may, or may not, suggest to some readers
the desirableness of further inquiry; the author certainly does not
hope to do more, if as much.</p>
<p>It may be urged that many of the stories here narrated come from
remote times, and, as the testimony for these cannot be rigidly studied,
that the old unauthenticated stories clash with the analogous tales
current on better authority in our own day.&nbsp; But these ancient
legends are given, not as evidence, but for three reasons: first, because
of their merit as mere stories; next, because several of them are now
perhaps for the first time offered with a critical discussion of their
historical sources; lastly, because the old legends seem to show how
the fancy of periods less critical than ours dealt with such facts as
are now reported in a dull undramatic manner.&nbsp; Thus (1) the Icelandic
ghost stories have peculiar literary merit as simple dramatic narratives.&nbsp;
(2) Every one has heard of the Wesley ghost, Sir George Villiers&rsquo;s
spectre, Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s ghost, the Beresford ghost, Mr. Williams&rsquo;s
dream of Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s murder, and so forth.&nbsp; But the original
sources have not, as a rule, been examined in the ordinary spirit of
calm historical criticism, by aid of a comparison of the earliest versions
in print or manuscript.&nbsp; (3) Even ghost stories, as a rule, have
some basis of fact, whether fact of hallucination, or illusion, or imposture.&nbsp;
They are, at lowest, &ldquo;human documents&rdquo;.&nbsp; Now, granting
such facts (of imposture, hallucination, or what you will), as our dull,
modern narratives contain, we can regard these facts, or things like
these, as the <i>nuclei</i> which our less critical ancestors elaborated
into their extraordinary romances.&nbsp; In this way the belief in demoniacal
possession (distinguished, as such, from madness and epilepsy) has its
nucleus, some contend, in the phenomena of alternating personalities
in certain patients.&nbsp; Their characters, ideas, habits, and even
voices change, and the most obvious solution of the problem, in the
past, was to suppose that a new alien personality&mdash;a &ldquo;devil&rdquo;&mdash;had
entered into the sufferer.</p>
<p>Again, the phenomena occurring in &ldquo;haunted houses&rdquo; (whether
caused, or not, by imposture or hallucination, or both) were easily
magnified into such legends as that of Grettir and Glam, and into the
monstrosities of the witch trials.&nbsp; Once more the simple hallucination
of a dead person&rsquo;s appearance in his house demanded an explanation.&nbsp;
This was easily given by evolving a legend that he was a spirit, escaped
from purgatory or the grave, to fulfil a definite purpose.&nbsp; The
rarity of such purposeful ghosts in an age like ours, so rich in ghost
stories, must have a cause.&nbsp; That cause is, probably, a dwindling
of the myth-making faculty.</p>
<p>Any one who takes these matters seriously, as facts in human nature,
must have discovered the difficulty of getting evidence at first hand.&nbsp;
This arises from several causes.&nbsp; First, the cock-sure common-sense
of the years from 1660 to 1850, or so, regarded every one who had experience
of a hallucination as a dupe, a lunatic, or a liar.&nbsp; In this healthy
state of opinion, eminent people like Lord Brougham kept their experience
to themselves, or, at most, nervously protested that they &ldquo;were
sure it was only a dream&rdquo;.&nbsp; Next, to tell the story was,
often, to enter on a narrative of intimate, perhaps painful, domestic
circumstances.&nbsp; Thirdly, many persons now refuse information as
a matter of &ldquo;principle,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;religious principle,&rdquo;
though it is difficult to see where either principle or religion is
concerned, if the witness is telling what he believes to be true.&nbsp;
Next, some devotees of science aver that these studies may bring back
faith by a side wind, and, with faith, the fires of Smithfield and the
torturing of witches.&nbsp; These opponents are what Professor Huxley
called &ldquo;dreadful consequences argufiers,&rdquo; when similar reasons
were urged against the doctrine of evolution.&nbsp; Their position is
strongest when they maintain that these topics have a tendency to befog
the intellect.&nbsp; A desire to prove the existence of &ldquo;new forces&rdquo;
may beget indifference to logic and to the laws of evidence.&nbsp; This
is true, and we have several dreadful examples among men otherwise scientific.&nbsp;
But all studies have their temptations.&nbsp; Many a historian, to prove
the guilt or innocence of Queen Mary, has put evidence, and logic, and
common honesty far from him.&nbsp; Yet this is no reason for abandoning
the study of history.</p>
<p>There is another class of difficulties.&nbsp; As anthropology becomes
popular, every inquirer knows what customs he <i>ought</i> to find among
savages, so, of course, he finds them.&nbsp; In the same way, people
may now know what customs it is orthodox to find among ghosts, and may
pretend to find them, or may simulate them by imposture.&nbsp; The white
sheet and clanking chains are forsaken for a more realistic rendering
of the ghostly part.&nbsp; The desire of social notoriety may beget
wanton fabrications.&nbsp; In short, all studies have their perils,
and these are among the dangers which beset the path of the inquirer
into things ghostly.&nbsp; He must adopt the stoical maxim: &ldquo;Be
sober and do not believe&rdquo;&mdash;in a hurry.</p>
<p>If there be truth in even one case of &ldquo;telepathy,&rdquo; it
will follow that the human soul is a thing endowed with attributes not
yet recognised by science.&nbsp; It cannot be denied that this is a
serious consideration, and that very startling consequences might be
deduced from it; such beliefs, indeed, as were generally entertained
in the ages of Christian darkness which preceded the present era of
enlightenment.&nbsp; But our business in studies of any kind is, of
course, with truth, as we are often told, not with the consequences,
however ruinous to our most settled convictions, or however pernicious
to society.</p>
<p>The very opposite objection comes from the side of religion.&nbsp;
These things we learn, are spiritual mysteries into which men must not
inquire.&nbsp; This is only a relic of the ancient opinion that he was
an impious character who first launched a boat, God having made man
a terrestrial animal.&nbsp; Assuredly God put us into a world of phenomena,
and gave us inquiring minds.&nbsp; We have as much right to explore
the phenomena of these minds as to explore the ocean.&nbsp; Again, if
it be said that our inquiries may lead to an undignified theory of the
future life (so far they have not led to any theory at all), that, also,
is the position of the Dreadful Consequences Argufier.&nbsp; Lastly,
&ldquo;the stories may frighten children&rdquo;.&nbsp; For children
the book is not written, any more than if it were a treatise on comparative
anatomy.</p>
<p>The author has frequently been asked, both publicly and privately:
&ldquo;Do you believe in ghosts?&rdquo;&nbsp; One can only answer: &ldquo;How
do you define a ghost?&rdquo;&nbsp; I do believe, with all students
of human nature, in hallucinations of one, or of several, or even of
all the senses.&nbsp; But as to whether such hallucinations, among the
sane, are ever caused by psychical influences from the minds of others,
alive or dead, not communicated through the ordinary channels of sense,
my mind is in a balance of doubt.&nbsp; It is a question of evidence.</p>
<p>In this collection many stories are given without the real names
of the witnesses.&nbsp; In most of the cases the real names, and their
owners, are well known to myself.&nbsp; In not publishing the names
I only take the common privilege of writers on medicine and psychology.&nbsp;
In other instances the names are known to the managers of the Society
for Psychical Research, who have kindly permitted me to borrow from
their collections.</p>
<p>While this book passed through the press, a long correspondence called
&ldquo;On the Trail of a Ghost&rdquo; appeared in <i>The Times</i>.&nbsp;
It illustrated the copious fallacies which haunt the human intellect.&nbsp;
Thus it was maintained by some persons, and denied by others, that sounds
of unknown origin were occasionally heard in a certain house.&nbsp;
These, it was suggested, might (if really heard) be caused by slight
seismic disturbances.&nbsp; Now many people argue, &ldquo;Blunderstone
House is not haunted, for I passed a night there, and nothing unusual
occurred&rdquo;.&nbsp; Apply this to a house where noises are actually
caused by young earthquakes.&nbsp; Would anybody say: &ldquo;There are
no seismic disturbances near Blunderstone House, for I passed a night
there, and none occurred&rdquo;?&nbsp; Why should a noisy ghost (if
there is such a thing) or a hallucinatory sound (if there is such a
thing), be expected to be more punctual and pertinacious than a seismic
disturbance?&nbsp; Again, the gentleman who opened the correspondence
with a long statement on the negative side, cried out, like others,
for scientific publicity, for names of people and places.&nbsp; But
neither he nor his allies gave their own names.&nbsp; He did not precisely
establish his claim to confidence by publishing his version of private
conversations.&nbsp; Yet he expected science and the public to believe
his anonymous account of a conversation, with an unnamed person, at
which he did not and could not pretend to have been present.&nbsp; He
had a theory of sounds heard by himself which could have been proved,
or disproved, in five minutes, by a simple experiment.&nbsp; But that
experiment he does not say that he made.</p>
<p>This kind of evidence is thought good enough on the negative side.&nbsp;
It certainly would not be accepted by any sane person for the affirmative
side.&nbsp; If what is called psychical research has no other results,
at least it enables us to perceive the fallacies which can impose on
the credulity of common-sense.</p>
<p>In preparing this collection of tales, I owe much to Mr. W. A. Craigie,
who translated the stories from the Gaelic and the Icelandic; to Miss
Elspeth Campbell, who gives a version of the curious Argyll tradition
of Ticonderoga (rhymed by Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson, who put a Cameron
where a Campbell should be); to Miss Violet Simpson, who found the Windham
MS. about the Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s story, and made other researches;
and to Miss Goodrich Freer, who pointed out the family version of &ldquo;The
Tyrone Ghost&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Arbuthnot, in his humorous work on <i>Political Lying</i>, commends
the Whigs for occasionally trying the people with &ldquo;great swingeing
falsehoods&rdquo;.&nbsp; When these are once got down by the populace,
anything may follow without difficulty.&nbsp; Excellently as this practice
has worked in politics (compare the warming-pan lie of 1688), in the
telling of ghost stories a different plan has its merits.&nbsp; Beginning
with the common-place and familiar, and therefore credible, with the
thin end of the wedge, in fact, a wise narrator will advance to the
rather unusual, the extremely rare, the undeniably startling, and so
arrive at statements which, without this discreet and gradual initiation,
a hasty reader might, justly or unjustly, dismiss as &ldquo;great swingeing
falsehoods&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The nature of things and of men has fortunately made this method
at once easy, obvious, and scientific.&nbsp; Even in the rather fantastic
realm of ghosts, the stories fall into regular groups, advancing in
difficulty, like exercises in music or in a foreign language.&nbsp;
We therefore start from the easiest Exercises in Belief, or even from
those which present no difficulty at all.&nbsp; The defect of the method
is that easy stories are dull reading.&nbsp; But the student can &ldquo;skip&rdquo;.&nbsp;
We begin with common every-night dreams.</p>
<p>Sleeping is as natural as waking; dreams are nearly as frequent as
every-day sensations, thoughts, and emotions.&nbsp; But dreams, being
familiar, are credible; it is admitted that people do dream; we reach
the less credible as we advance to the less familiar.&nbsp; For, if
we think for a moment, the alleged events of ghostdom&mdash;apparitions
of all sorts&mdash;are precisely identical with the every-night phenomena
of dreaming, except for the avowed element of sleep in dreams.</p>
<p>In dreams, time and space are annihilated, and two severed lovers
may be made happy.&nbsp; In dreams, amidst a grotesque confusion of
things remembered and things forgot, we <i>see</i> the events of the
past (I have been at Culloden fight and at the siege of Troy); we are
present in places remote; we behold the absent; we converse with the
dead, and we may even (let us say by chance coincidence) forecast the
future.&nbsp; All these things, except the last, are familiar to everybody
who dreams.&nbsp; It is also certain that similar, but yet more vivid,
false experiences may be produced, at the word of the hypnotiser, in
persons under the hypnotic sleep.&nbsp; A hypnotised man will take water
for wine, and get drunk on it.</p>
<p>Now, the ghostly is nothing but the experience, when men are awake,
or <i>apparently</i> awake, of the every-night phenomena of dreaming.&nbsp;
The vision of the absent seen by a waking, or apparently waking, man
is called &ldquo;a wraith&rdquo;; the waking, or apparently waking,
vision of the dead is called &ldquo;a ghost&rdquo;.&nbsp; Yet, as St.
Augustine says, the absent man, or the dead man, may know no more of
the vision, and may have no more to do with causing it, than have the
absent or the dead whom we are perfectly accustomed to see in our dreams.&nbsp;
Moreover, the comparatively rare cases in which two or more waking people
are alleged to have seen the same &ldquo;ghost,&rdquo; simultaneously
or in succession, have <i>their</i> parallel in sleep, where two or
more persons simultaneously dream the same dream.&nbsp; Of this curious
fact let us give one example: the names only are altered.</p>
<h3>THE DOG FANTI</h3>
<p>Mrs. Ogilvie of Drumquaigh had a poodle named Fanti.&nbsp; Her family,
or at least those who lived with her, were her son, the laird, and three
daughters.&nbsp; Of these the two younger, at a certain recent date,
were paying a short visit to a neighbouring country house.&nbsp; Mrs.
Ogilvie was accustomed to breakfast in her bedroom, not being in the
best of health.&nbsp; One morning Miss Ogilvie came down to breakfast
and said to her brother, &ldquo;I had an odd dream; I dreamed Fanti
went mad&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that <i>is</i> odd,&rdquo; said her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
did I.&nbsp; We had better not tell mother; it might make her nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ogilvie went up after breakfast to see the elder lady, who said,
&ldquo;Do turn out Fanti; I dreamed last night that he went mad and
bit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the two younger sisters came home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you enjoy yourselves?&rdquo; one of the others asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t sleep well.&nbsp; I was dreaming that Fanti
went mad when Mary wakened me, and said she had dreamed Fanti went mad,
and turned into a cat, and we threw him into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, as several people may see the same ghost at once, several people
may dream the same dream at once.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, Fanti lived,
sane and harmless, &ldquo;all the length of all his years&rdquo;. <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a></p>
<p>Now, this anecdote is credible, certainly is credible by people who
know the dreaming family.&nbsp; It is nothing more than a curiosity
of coincidences; and, as Fanti remained a sober, peaceful hound, in
face of five dreamers, the absence of fulfilment increases the readiness
of belief.&nbsp; But compare the case of the Swithinbanks.&nbsp; Mr.
Swithinbank, on 20th May, 1883, signed for publication a statement to
this effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>During the Peninsular war his father and his two brothers were quartered
at Dover.&nbsp; Their family were at Bradford.&nbsp; The brothers slept
in various quarters of Dover camp.&nbsp; One morning they met after
parade.&nbsp; &ldquo;O William, I have had a queer dream,&rdquo; said
Mr. Swithinbank&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; replied
the brother, when, to the astonishment of both, the other brother, John,
said, &ldquo;I have had a queer dream as well.&nbsp; I dreamt that mother
was dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said each of the
other brothers.&nbsp; And the mother had died on the night of this dreaming.&nbsp;
Mrs. Hudson, daughter of one of the brothers, heard the story from all
three. <a name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a">{5a}</a></p>
<p>The distribution of the fulfilled is less than that of the unfulfilled
dream by three to five.&nbsp; It has the extra coincidence of the death.&nbsp;
But as it is very common to dream of deaths, some such dreams must occasionally
hit the target.</p>
<p>Other examples might be given of shared dreams: <a name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b">{5b}</a>
they are only mentioned here to prove that all the <i>waking</i> experiences
of things ghostly, such as visions of the absent and of the dead, and
of the non-existent, are familiar, and may even be common simultaneously
to several persons, in <i>sleep</i>.&nbsp; That men may sleep without
being aware of it, even while walking abroad; that we may drift, while
we think ourselves awake, into a semi-somnolent state for a period of
time perhaps almost imperceptible is certain enough.&nbsp; Now, the
peculiarity of sleep is to expand or contract time, as we may choose
to put the case.&nbsp; Alfred Maury, the well-known writer on Greek
religion, dreamed a long, vivid dream of the Reign of Terror, of his
own trial before a Revolutionary Tribunal, and of his execution, in
the moment of time during which he was awakened by the accidental fall
of a rod in the canopy of his bed, which touched him on the neck.&nbsp;
Thus even a prolonged interview with a ghost may <i>conceivably</i>
be, in real time, a less than momentary dream occupying an imperceptible
tenth of a second of somnolence, the sleeper not realising that he has
been asleep.</p>
<p>Mark Twain, who is seriously interested in these subjects, has published
an experience illustrative of such possibilities.&nbsp; He tells his
tale at considerable length, but it amounts to this:&mdash;</p>
<h3>MARK TWAIN&rsquo;S STORY</h3>
<p>Mark was smoking his cigar outside the door of his house when he
saw a man, a stranger, approaching him.&nbsp; Suddenly he ceased to
be visible!&nbsp; Mark, who had long desired to see a ghost, rushed
into his house to record the phenomenon.&nbsp; There, seated on a chair
in the hall, was the very man, who had come on some business.&nbsp;
As Mark&rsquo;s negro footman acts, when the bell is rung, on the principle,
&ldquo;Perhaps they won&rsquo;t persevere,&rdquo; his master is wholly
unable to account for the disappearance of the visitor, whom he never
saw passing him or waiting at his door&mdash;except on the theory of
an unconscious nap.&nbsp; Now, a disappearance is quite as mystical
as an appearance, and much less common.</p>
<p>This theory, that apparitions come in an infinitesimal moment of
sleep, while a man is conscious of his surroundings and believes himself
to be awake was the current explanation of ghosts in the eighteenth
century.&nbsp; Any educated man who &ldquo;saw a ghost&rdquo; or &ldquo;had
a hallucination&rdquo; called it a &ldquo;dream,&rdquo; as Lord Brougham
and Lord Lyttelton did.&nbsp; But, if the death of the person seen coincided
with his appearance to them, they illogically argued that, out of the
innumerable multitude of dreams, some <i>must</i> coincide, accidentally,
with facts.&nbsp; They strove to forget that though dreams in sleep
are universal and countless, &ldquo;dreams&rdquo; in waking hours are
extremely rare&mdash;unique, for instance, in Lord Brougham&rsquo;s
own experience.&nbsp; Therefore, the odds against chance coincidence
are very great.</p>
<p>Dreams only form subjects of good dream-stories when the vision coincides
with and adequately represents an <i>unknown</i> event in the past,
the present, or the future.&nbsp; We dream, however vividly, of the
murder of Rizzio.&nbsp; Nobody is surprised at that, the incident being
familiar to most people, in history and art.&nbsp; But, if we dreamed
of being present at an unchronicled scene in Queen Mary&rsquo;s life,
and if, <i>after</i> the dream was recorded, a document proving its
accuracy should be for the first time recovered, then there is matter
for a good dream-story. <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8">{8}</a>&nbsp;
Again, we dream of an event not to be naturally guessed or known by
us, and our dream (which should be recorded before tidings of the fact
arrive) tallies with the news of the event when it comes.&nbsp; Or,
finally, we dream of an event (recording the dream), and that event
occurs in the future.&nbsp; In all these cases the actual occurrence
of the unknown event is the only addition to the dream&rsquo;s usual
power of crumpling up time and space.</p>
<p>As a rule such dreams are only mentioned <i>after</i> the event,
and so are not worth noticing.&nbsp; Very often the dream is forgotten
by the dreamer till he hears of or sees the event.&nbsp; He is then
either reminded of his dream by association of ideas or <i>he has never
dreamed at all</i>, and his belief that he has dreamed is only a form
of false memory, of the common sensation of &ldquo;having been here
before,&rdquo; which he attributes to an awakened memory of a real dream.&nbsp;
Still more often the dream is unconsciously cooked by the narrator into
harmony with facts.</p>
<p>As a rule fulfilled dreams deal with the most trivial affairs, and
such as, being usual, may readily occur by chance coincidence.&nbsp;
Indeed it is impossible to set limits to such coincidence, for it would
indeed be extraordinary if extraordinary coincidences never occurred.</p>
<p>To take examples:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE PIG IN THE DINING-ROOM</h3>
<p>Mrs. Atlay, wife of a late Bishop of Hereford, dreamed one night
that there was a pig in the dining-room of the palace.&nbsp; She came
downstairs, and in the hall told her governess and children of the dream,
before family prayers.&nbsp; When these were over, nobody who was told
the story having left the hall in the interval, she went into the dining-room
and there was the pig.&nbsp; It was proved to have escaped from the
sty after Mrs. Atlay got up.&nbsp; Here the dream is of the common grotesque
type; millions of such things are dreamed.&nbsp; The event, the pig
in the palace, is unusual, and the coincidence of pig and dream is still
more so.&nbsp; But unusual events must occur, and each has millions
of dreams as targets to aim at, so to speak.&nbsp; It would be surprising
if no such target were ever hit.</p>
<p>Here is another case&mdash;curious because the dream was forgotten
till the corresponding event occurred, but there was a slight discrepancy
between event and dream.</p>
<h3>THE MIGNONETTE</h3>
<p>Mrs. Herbert returned with her husband from London to their country
home on the Border.&nbsp; They arrived rather late in the day, prepared
to visit the garden, and decided to put off the visit till the morrow.&nbsp;
At night Mrs. Herbert dreamed that they went into the garden, down a
long walk to a mignonette bed near the vinery.&nbsp; The mignonette
was black with innumerable bees, and Wilburd, the gardener, came up
and advised Mr. and Mrs. Herbert not to go nearer.&nbsp; Next morning
the pair went to the garden.&nbsp; The air round the mignonette was
dark with <i>wasps</i>.&nbsp; Mrs. Herbert now first remembered and
told her dream, adding, &ldquo;but in the dream they were <i>bees</i>&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Wilburd now came up and advised them not to go nearer, as a wasps&rsquo;
nest had been injured and the wasps were on the warpath.</p>
<p>Here accidental coincidence is probable enough. <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10">{10}</a>&nbsp;
There is another class of dreams very useful, and apparently not so
very uncommon, that are veracious and communicate correct information,
which the dreamer did not know that he knew and was very anxious to
know.&nbsp; These are rare enough to be rather difficult to believe.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE LOST CHEQUE</h3>
<p>Mr. A., a barrister, sat up one night to write letters, and about
half-past twelve went out to put them in the post.&nbsp; On undressing
he missed a cheque for a large sum, which he had received during the
day.&nbsp; He hunted everywhere in vain, went to bed, slept, and dreamed
that he saw the cheque curled round an area railing not far from his
own door.&nbsp; He woke, got up, dressed, walked down the street and
found his cheque in the place he had dreamed of.&nbsp; In his opinion
he had noticed it fall from his pocket as he walked to the letter-box,
without consciously remarking it, and his deeper memory awoke in slumber.

<h3>THE DUCKS&rsquo; EGGS</h3>
<p>A little girl of the author&rsquo;s family kept ducks and was anxious
to sell the eggs to her mother.&nbsp; But the eggs could not be found
by eager search.&nbsp; On going to bed she said, &ldquo;Perhaps I shall
dream of them&rdquo;.&nbsp; Next morning she exclaimed, &ldquo;I <i>did</i>
dream of them, they are in a place between grey rock, broom, and mallow;
that must be &lsquo;The Poney&rsquo;s Field&rsquo;!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
there the eggs were found. <a name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b">{11b}</a></p>
<h3>THE LOST KEY</h3>
<p>Lady X., after walking in a wood near her house in Ireland, found
that she had lost an important key.&nbsp; She dreamed that it was lying
at the root of a certain tree, where she found it next day, and her
theory is the same as that of Mr. A., the owner of the lost cheque.
<a name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c">{11c}</a></p>
<p>As a rule dreams throw everything into a dramatic form.&nbsp; Some
one knocks at our door, and the dream bases a little drama on the noise;
it constructs an explanatory myth, a myth to account for the noise,
which is acted out in the theatre of the brain.</p>
<p>To take an instance, a disappointing one:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE LOST SECURITIES</h3>
<p>A lady dreamed that she was sitting at a window, watching the end
of an autumn sunset.&nbsp; There came a knock at the front door and
a gentleman and lady were ushered in.&nbsp; The gentleman wore an old-fashioned
snuff-coloured suit, of the beginning of the century; he was, in fact,
an aged uncle, who, during the Napoleonic wars, had been one of the
English <i>d&eacute;tenus</i> in France.&nbsp; The lady was very beautiful
and wore something like a black Spanish mantilla.&nbsp; The pair carried
with them a curiously wrought steel box.&nbsp; Before conversation was
begun, the maid (still in the dream) brought in the lady&rsquo;s chocolate
and the figures vanished.&nbsp; When the maid withdrew, the figures
reappeared standing by the table.&nbsp; The box was now open, and the
old gentleman drew forth some yellow papers, written on in faded ink.&nbsp;
These, he said, were lists of securities, which had been in his possession,
when he went abroad in 18--, and in France became engaged to his beautiful
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The securities,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are now in the strong
box of Messrs. ---;&rdquo; another rap at the door, and the actual maid
entered with real hot water.&nbsp; It was time to get up.&nbsp; The
whole dream had its origin in the first rap, heard by the dreamer and
dramatised into the arrival of visitors.&nbsp; Probably it did not last
for more than two or three seconds of real time.&nbsp; The maid&rsquo;s
second knock just prevented the revelation of the name of &ldquo;Messrs.
---,&rdquo; who, like the lady in the mantilla, were probably non-existent
people. <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13">{13}</a></p>
<p>Thus dream dramatises on the impulse of some faint, hardly perceived
real sensation.&nbsp; And thus either mere empty fancies (as in the
case of the lost securities) or actual knowledge which we may have once
possessed but have totally forgotten, or conclusions which have passed
through our brains as unheeded guesses, may in a dream be, as it were,
&ldquo;revealed&rdquo; through the lips of a character in the brain&rsquo;s
theatre&mdash;that character may, in fact, be alive, or dead, or merely
fantastical.&nbsp; A very good case is given with this explanation (lost
knowledge revived in a dramatic dream about a dead man) by Sir Walter
Scott in a note to <i>The Antiquary</i>.&nbsp; Familiar as the story
is it may be offered here, for a reason which will presently be obvious.</p>
<h3>THE ARREARS OF TEIND</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rutherford, of Bowland, a gentleman of landed property
in the Vale of Gala, was prosecuted for a very considerable sum, the
accumulated arrears of teind (or tithe) for which he was said to be
indebted to a noble family, the titulars (lay impropriators of the tithes).&nbsp;
Mr. Rutherford was strongly impressed with the belief that his father
had, by a form of process peculiar to the law of Scotland, purchased
these teinds from the titular, and, therefore, that the present prosecution
was groundless.&nbsp; But, after an industrious search among his father&rsquo;s
papers, an investigation among the public records and a careful inquiry
among all persons who had transacted law business for his father, no
evidence could be recovered to support his defence.&nbsp; The period
was now near at hand, when he conceived the loss of his law-suit to
be inevitable; and he had formed the determination to ride to Edinburgh
next day and make the best bargain he could in the way of compromise.&nbsp;
He went to bed with this resolution, and, with all the circumstances
of the case floating upon his mind, had a dream to the following purpose.&nbsp;
His father, who had been many years dead, appeared to him, he thought,
and asked him why he was disturbed in his mind.&nbsp; In dreams men
are not surprised at such apparitions.&nbsp; Mr. Rutherford thought
that he informed his father of the cause of his distress, adding that
the payment of a considerable sum of money was the more unpleasant to
him because he had a strong consciousness that it was not due, though
he was unable to recover any evidence in support of his belief.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are right, my son,&rsquo; replied the paternal shade.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I did acquire right to these teinds for payment of which you
are now prosecuted.&nbsp; The papers relating to the transaction are
in the hands of Mr. ---, a writer (or attorney), who is now retired
from professional business and resides at Inveresk, near Edinburgh.&nbsp;
He was a person whom I employed on that occasion for a particular reason,
but who never on any other occasion transacted business on my account.&nbsp;
It is very possible,&rsquo; pursued the vision, &lsquo;that Mr. ---
may have forgotten a matter which is now of a very old date; but you
may call it to his recollection by this token, that when I came to pay
his account there was difficulty in getting change for a Portugal piece
of gold and we were forced to drink out the balance at a tavern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rutherford awoke in the morning with all the words of
the vision imprinted on his mind, and thought it worth while to walk
across the country to Inveresk instead of going straight to Edinburgh.&nbsp;
When he came there he waited on the gentleman mentioned in the dream&mdash;a
very old man.&nbsp; Without saying anything of the vision he inquired
whether he ever remembered having conducted such a matter for his deceased
father.&nbsp; The old gentleman could not at first bring the circumstance
to his recollection, but on mention of the Portugal piece of gold the
whole returned upon his memory.&nbsp; He made an immediate search for
the papers and recovered them, so that Mr. Rutherford carried to Edinburgh
the documents necessary to gain the cause which he was on the verge
of losing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story is reproduced because it is clearly one of the tales which
come round in cycles, either because events repeat themselves or because
people will unconsciously localise old legends in new places and assign
old occurrences or fables to new persons.&nbsp; Thus every one has heard
how Lord Westbury called a certain man in the Herald&rsquo;s office
&ldquo;a foolish old fellow who did not even know his own foolish old
business&rdquo;.&nbsp; Lord Westbury may very well have said this, but
long before his time the remark was attributed to the famous Lord Chesterfield.&nbsp;
Lord Westbury may have quoted it from Chesterfield or hit on it by accident,
or the old story may have been assigned to him.&nbsp; In the same way
Mr. Rutherford may have had his dream or the following tale of St. Augustine&rsquo;s
(also cited by Scott) may have been attributed to him, with the picturesque
addition about the piece of Portuguese gold.&nbsp; Except for the piece
of Portuguese gold St. Augustine practically tells the anecdote in his
<i>De Cura pro Mortuis Habenda</i>, adding the acute reflection which
follows. <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16">{16}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a surety, when we were at Milan, we heard tell of a certain
person of whom was demanded payment of a debt, with production of his
deceased father&rsquo;s acknowledgment, which debt, unknown to the son,
the father had paid, whereupon the man began to be very sorrowful, and
to marvel that his father while dying did not tell him what he owed
when he also made his will.&nbsp; Then in this exceeding anxiousness
of his, his said father appeared to him in a dream, and made known to
him where was the counter acknowledgment by which that acknowledgment
was cancelled.&nbsp; Which when the young man had found and showed,
he not only rebutted the wrongful claim of a false debt, but also got
back his father&rsquo;s note of hand, which the father had not got back
when the money was paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here then the soul of a man is supposed to have had care for
his son, and to have come to him in his sleep, that, teaching him what
he did not know, he might relieve him of a great trouble.&nbsp; But
about the very same time as we heard this, it chanced at Carthage that
the rhetorician Eulogius, who had been my disciple in that art, being
(as he himself, after our return to Africa, told us the story) in course
of lecturing to his disciples on Cicero&rsquo;s rhetorical books, as
he looked over the portion of reading which he was to deliver on the
following day, fell upon a certain passage, and not being able to understand
it, was scarce able to sleep for the trouble of his mind: in which night,
as he dreamed, I expounded to him that which he did not understand;
nay, not I, but my likeness, while I was unconscious of the thing and
far away beyond sea, it might be doing, or it might be dreaming, some
other thing, and not in the least caring for his cares.&nbsp; In what
way these things come about I know not; but in what way soever they
come, why do we not believe it comes in the same way for a person in
a dream to see a dead man, as it comes that he sees a living man? both,
no doubt, neither knowing nor caring who dreams of their images, or
where or when.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like dreams, moreover, are some visions of persons awake,
who have had their senses troubled, such as phrenetic persons, or those
who are mad in any way, for they, too, talk to themselves just as though
they were speaking to people verily present, and as well with absent
men as with present, whose images they perceive whether persons living
or dead.&nbsp; But just as they who live are unconscious that they are
seen of them and talk with them (for indeed they are not really themselves
present, or themselves make speeches, but through troubled senses these
persons are wrought upon by such like imaginary visions), just so they
also who have departed this life, to persons thus affected appear as
present while they be absent, and are themselves utterly unconscious
whether any man sees them in regard of their image.&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18">{18}</a></p>
<p>St. Augustine adds a similar story of a trance.</p>
<h3>THE TWO CURMAS</h3>
<p>A rustic named Curma, of Tullium, near Hippo, Augustine&rsquo;s town,
fell into a catalepsy.&nbsp; On reviving he said: &ldquo;Run to the
house of Curma the smith and see what is going on&rdquo;.&nbsp; Curma
the smith was found to have died just when the other Curma awoke.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said the invalid, &ldquo;for I heard it said
in that place whence I have returned that not I, Curma of the Curia,
but Curma the smith, was wanted.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Curma of the Curia
saw living as well as dead people, among others Augustine, who, in his
vision, baptised him at Hippo.&nbsp; Curma then, in the vision, went
to Paradise, where he was told to go and be baptised.&nbsp; He said
it had been done already, and was answered, &ldquo;Go and be truly baptised,
for <i>that</i> thou didst but see in vision&rdquo;.&nbsp; So Augustine
christened him, and later, hearing of the trance, asked him about it,
when he repeated the tale already familiar to his neighbours.&nbsp;
Augustine thinks it a mere dream, and apparently regards the death of
Curma the smith as a casual coincidence.&nbsp; <i>Un esprit fort, le
Saint Augustin</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the dead could come in dreams,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;my
pious mother would no night fail to visit me.&nbsp; Far be the thought
that she should, by a happier life, have been made so cruel that, when
aught vexes my heart, she should not even console in a dream the son
whom she loved with an only love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only things once probably known, yet forgotten, but knowledge
never <i>consciously</i> thought out, may be revealed in a dramatic
dream, apparently through the lips of the dead or the never existent.&nbsp;
The books of psychology are rich in examples of problems worked out,
or music or poetry composed in sleep.&nbsp; The following is a more
recent and very striking example:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE ASSYRIAN PRIEST</h3>
<p>Herr H. V. Hilprecht is Professor of Assyriology in the University
of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; That university had despatched an expedition
to explore the ruins of Babylon, and sketches of the objects discovered
had been sent home.&nbsp; Among these were drawings of two small fragments
of agate, inscribed with characters.&nbsp; One Saturday night in March,
1893, Professor Hilprecht had wearied himself with puzzling over these
two fragments, which were supposed to be broken pieces of finger-rings.&nbsp;
He was inclined, from the nature of the characters, to date them about
1700-1140 B.C.; and as the first character of the third line of the
first fragment seemed to read KU, he guessed that it might stand for
Kurigalzu, a king of that name.</p>
<p>About midnight the professor went, weary and perplexed, to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I dreamed the following remarkable dream.&nbsp; A tall
thin priest of the old pre-Christian Nippur, about forty years of age,
and clad in a simple <i>abba</i>, led me to the treasure-chamber of
the temple, on its south-east side.&nbsp; He went with me into a small
low-ceiled room without windows, in which there was a large wooden chest,
while scraps of agate and <i>lapis lazuli</i> lay scattered on the floor.&nbsp;
Here he addressed me as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The two fragments, which you have published separately
upon pages 22 and 26, <i>belong together</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; (this amazing
Assyrian priest spoke American!). <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20">{20}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;They are not finger-rings, and their history is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;King Kurigalzu (about 1300 B.C.) once sent to the temple
of Bel, among other articles of agate and <i>lapis lazuli</i>, an inscribed
votive cylinder of agate.&nbsp; Then the priests suddenly received the
command to make for the statue of the god Nibib a pair of ear-rings
of agate.&nbsp; We were in great dismay, since there was no agate as
raw material at hand.&nbsp; In order to execute the command there was
nothing for us to do but cut the votive cylinder in three parts, thus
making three rings, each of which contained a portion of the original
inscription.&nbsp; The first two rings served as ear-rings for the statue
of the god; the two fragments which have given you so much trouble are
parts of them.&nbsp; If you will put the two together, you will have
confirmation of my words.&nbsp; But the third ring you have not found
yet, and you never will find it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor awoke, bounded out of bed, as Mrs. Hilprecht testifies,
and was heard crying from his study, &ldquo;It is so, it is so!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Hilprecht followed her lord, &ldquo;and satisfied myself in the
midnight hour as to the outcome of his most interesting dream&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The professor, however, says that he awoke, told his wife the dream,
and verified it next day.&nbsp; Both statements are correct.&nbsp; There
were two sets of drawings, one in the study (used that night) one used
next day in the University Library.</p>
<p>The inscription ran thus, the missing fragment being restored, &ldquo;by
analogy from many similar inscriptions&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>TO THE GOD NIBIB, CHILD<br />
OF THE GOD BEL,<br />
HIS LORD<br />
KURIGALZU,<br />
PONTIFEX OF THE GOD BEL<br />
HAS PRESENTED IT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, in the drawings, the fragments were of different colours, so
that a student working on the drawings would not guess them to be parts
of one cylinder.&nbsp; Professor Hilprecht, however, examined the two
actual fragments in the Imperial Museum at Constantinople.&nbsp; They
lay in two distinct cases, but, when put together, fitted.&nbsp; When
cut asunder of old, in Babylon, the white vein of the stone showed on
one fragment, the grey surface on the other.</p>
<p>Professor Romaine Newbold, who publishes this dream, explains that
the professor had unconsciously reasoned out his facts, the difference
of colour in the two pieces of agate disappearing in the dream.&nbsp;
The professor had heard from Dr. Peters of the expedition, that a room
had been discovered with fragments of a wooden box and chips of agate
and <i>lapis lazuli</i>.&nbsp; The sleeping mind &ldquo;combined its
information,&rdquo; reasoned rightly from it, and threw its own conclusions
into a dramatic form, receiving the information from the lips of a priest
of Nippur.</p>
<p>Probably we do a good deal of reasoning in sleep.&nbsp; Professor
Hilprecht, in 1882-83, was working at a translation of an inscription
wherein came <i>Nab&ucirc;</i>&mdash;<i>Kud&ucirc;rru</i>&mdash;<i>usur</i>,
rendered by Professor Delitzsch &ldquo;Nebo protect my mortar-board&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Professor Hilprecht accepted this, but woke one morning with his mind
full of the thought that the words should be rendered &ldquo;Nebo protect
my boundary,&rdquo; which &ldquo;sounds a deal likelier,&rdquo; and
is now accepted.&nbsp; I myself, when working at the MSS. of the exiled
Stuarts, was puzzled by the scorched appearance of the paper on which
Prince Charlie&rsquo;s and the king&rsquo;s letters were often written
and by the peculiarities of the ink.&nbsp; I woke one morning with a
sudden flash of common-sense.&nbsp; Sympathetic ink had been used, and
the papers had been toasted or treated with acids.&nbsp; This I had
probably reasoned out in sleep, and, had I dreamed, my mind might have
dramatised the idea.&nbsp; Old Mr. Edgar, the king&rsquo;s secretary,
might have appeared and given me the explanation.&nbsp; Maury publishes
tales in which a forgotten fact was revealed to him in a dream from
the lips of a dream-character (<i>Le Sommeil et les R&ecirc;ves</i>,
pp. 142-143.&nbsp; The curious may also consult, on all these things,
<i>The Philosophy of Mysticism</i>, by Karl du Prel, translated by Mr.
Massey.&nbsp; The Assyrian Priest is in <i>Proceedings</i>, <i>S.P.R</i>.,
vol. xii., p. 14).</p>
<p>On the same plane as the dreams which we have been examining is the
waking sensation of the <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.</i></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been here before,<br />
But when or how I cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of us know this feeling, all the circumstances in which we find
ourselves have already occurred, we have a prophecy of what will happen
next &ldquo;on the tip of our tongues&rdquo; (like a half-remembered
name), and then the impression vanishes.&nbsp; Scott complains of suffering
through a whole dinner-party from this sensation, but he had written
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; for fifty printed pages on that day, and his brain
was breaking down.&nbsp; Of course psychology has explanations.&nbsp;
The scene <i>may</i> have really occurred before, or may be the result
of a malady of perception, or one hemisphere of the brain not working
in absolute simultaneousness with the other may produce a double impression,
the first being followed by the second, so that we really have had two
successive impressions, of which one seems much more remote in time
than it really was.&nbsp; Or we may have dreamed something like the
scene and forgotten the dream, or we may actually, in some not understood
manner, have had a &ldquo;prevision&rdquo; of what is now actual, as
when Shelley almost fainted on coming to a place near Oxford which he
had beheld in a dream.</p>
<p>Of course, if this &ldquo;prevision&rdquo; could be verified in detail,
we should come very near to dreams of the future fulfilled.&nbsp; Such
a thing&mdash;verification of a detail&mdash;led to the conversion of
William Hone, the free-thinker and Radical of the early century, who
consequently became a Christian and a pessimistic, clear-sighted Tory.&nbsp;
This tale of the <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>, therefore, leads up to
the marvellous narratives of dreams simultaneous with, or prophetic
of, events not capable of being guessed or inferred, or of events lost
in the historical past, but, later, recovered from documents.</p>
<p>Of Hone&rsquo;s affair there are two versions.&nbsp; Both may be
given, as they are short.&nbsp; If they illustrate the <i>d&eacute;j&agrave;
vu</i>, they also illustrate the fond discrepancies of all such narratives.
<a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24">{24}</a></p>
<h3>THE KNOT IN THE SHUTTER</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It is said that a dream produced a powerful effect on Hone&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; He dreamt that he was introduced into a room where he was
an entire stranger, and saw himself seated at a table, and on going
towards the window his attention was somehow or other attracted to the
window-shutter, and particularly to a knot in the wood, which was of
singular appearance; and on waking the whole scene, and especially the
knot in the shutter, left a most vivid impression on his mind.&nbsp;
Some time afterwards, on going, I think, into the country, he was at
some house shown into a chamber where he had never been before, and
which instantly struck him as being the identical chamber of his dream.&nbsp;
He turned directly to the window, where the same knot in the shutter
caught his eye.&nbsp; This incident, to his investigating spirit, induced
a train of reflection which overthrew his cherished theories of materialism,
and resulted in conviction that there were spiritual agencies as susceptible
of proof as any facts of physical science; and this appears to have
been one of the links in that mysterious chain of events by which, according
to the inscrutable purposes of the Divine will, man is sometimes compelled
to bow to an unseen and divine power, and ultimately to believe and
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of the Christian friends from whom, in his later years,
William Hone received so much kindness, has also furnished recollections
of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo; . . . Two or three anecdotes which he related are all I can
contribute towards a piece of mental history which, if preserved, would
have been highly interesting.&nbsp; The first in point of time as to
his taste of mind, was a circumstance which shook his confidence in
<i>materialism</i>, though it did not lead to his conversion.&nbsp;
It was one of those mental phenomena which he saw to be <i>inexplicable</i>
by the doctrines he then held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was as follows: He was called in the course of business
into a part of London quite new to him, and as he walked along the street
he noticed to himself that he had never been there; but on being shown
into a room in a house where he had to wait some time, he immediately
fancied that it was all familiar, that he had seen it before, &lsquo;and
if so,&rsquo; said he to himself, &lsquo;there is a very peculiar knot
in this shutter&rsquo;.&nbsp; He opened the shutter and found the knot.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now then,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;here is something I cannot
explain on my principles!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed the occurrence is not very explicable on any principles, as
a detail not visible without search was sought and verified, and that
by a habitual mocker at anything out of the common way.&nbsp; For example,
Hone published a comic explanation, correct or not, of the famous Stockwell
mystery.</p>
<p>Supposing Hone&rsquo;s story to be true, it naturally conducts us
to yet more unfamiliar, and therefore less credible dreams, in which
the unknown past, present, or future is correctly revealed.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing, not even a ghost, is so staggering to the powers
of belief as a well-authenticated dream which strikes the bull&rsquo;s
eye of facts not known to the dreamer nor capable of being guessed by
him.&nbsp; If the events beheld in the dream are far away in space,
or are remote in time past, the puzzle is difficult enough.&nbsp; But
if the events are still in the future, perhaps no kind of explanation
except a mere &ldquo;fluke&rdquo; can even be suggested.&nbsp; Say that
I dream of an event occurring at a distance, and that I record or act
on my dream before it is corroborated.&nbsp; Suppose, too, that the
event is not one which could be guessed, like the death of an invalid
or the result of a race or of an election.&nbsp; This would be odd enough,
but the facts of which I dreamed must have been present in the minds
of living people.&nbsp; Now, if there is such a thing as &ldquo;mental
telegraphy&rdquo; or &ldquo;telepathy,&rdquo; <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28">{28}</a>
my mind, in dream, may have &ldquo;tapped&rdquo; the minds of the people
who knew the facts.&nbsp; We may not believe in &ldquo;mental telegraphy,&rdquo;
but we can <i>imagine</i> it as one of the unknown possibilities of
nature.&nbsp; Again, if I dream of an unchronicled event in the past,
and if a letter of some historical person is later discovered which
confirms the accuracy of my dream, we can at least <i>conceive</i> (though
we need not believe) that the intelligence was telegraphed to my dreaming
mind from the mind of a <i>dead</i> actor in, or witness of the historical
scene, for the facts are unknown to living man.&nbsp; But even these
wild guesses cannot cover a dream which correctly reveals events of
the future; events necessarily not known to any finite mind of the living
or of the dead, and too full of detail for an explanation by aid of
chance coincidence.</p>
<p>In face of these difficulties mankind has gone on believing in dreams
of all three classes: dreams revealing the unknown present, the unknown
past, and the unknown future.&nbsp; The judicious reasonably set them
all aside as the results of fortuitous coincidence, or revived recollection,
or of the illusions of a false memory, or of imposture, conscious or
unconscious.&nbsp; However, the stories continue to be told, and our
business is with the stories.</p>
<p>Taking, first, dreams of the unknown past, we find a large modern
collection of these attributed to a lady named &ldquo;Miss A---&rdquo;.&nbsp;
They were waking dreams representing obscure incidents of the past,
and were later corroborated by records in books, newspapers and manuscripts.&nbsp;
But as these books and papers existed, and were known to exist, before
the occurrence of the visions, it is obvious that the matter of the
visions <i>may</i> have been derived from the books and so forth, or
at least, a sceptic will vastly prefer this explanation.&nbsp; What
we need is a dream or vision of the unknown past, corroborated by a
document <i>not known to exist</i> at the time when the vision took
place and was recorded.&nbsp; Probably there is no such instance, but
the following tale, picturesque in itself, has a kind of shadow of the
only satisfactory sort of corroboration.</p>
<p>The author responsible for this yarn is Dr. Gregory, F.R.S., Professor
of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp; After studying for
many years the real or alleged phenomena of what has been called mesmerism,
or electro-biology, or hypnotism, Dr. Gregory published in 1851 his
<i>Letters to a Candid Inquirer on Animal Magnetism.</i></p>
<p>Though a F.R.S. and a Professor of Chemistry, the Doctor had no more
idea of what constitutes evidence than a baby.&nbsp; He actually mixed
up the Tyrone with the Lyttelton ghost story!&nbsp; His legend of Queen
Mary&rsquo;s jewels is derived from (1) the note-book, <i>or</i> (2)
a letter containing, or professing to contain, extracts from the note-book,
of a Major Buckley, an Anglo-Indian officer.&nbsp; This gentleman used
to &ldquo;magnetise&rdquo; or hypnotise people, some of whom became
clairvoyant, as if possessed of eyes acting as &ldquo;double-patent-million
magnifiers,&rdquo; permeated by X rays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What follows is transcribed,&rdquo; says the Doctor, &ldquo;from
Major Buckley&rsquo;s note-book.&rdquo;&nbsp; We abridge the narrative.&nbsp;
Major Buckley hypnotised a young officer, who, on November 15, 1845,
fell into &ldquo;a deeper state&rdquo; of trance.&nbsp; Thence he awoke
into a &ldquo;clairvoyant&rdquo; condition and said:&mdash;</p>
<h3>QUEEN MARY&rsquo;S JEWELS</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a strange dream about your ring&rdquo; (a &ldquo;medallion&rdquo;
of Anthony and Cleopatra); &ldquo;it is very valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Buckley said it was worth &pound;60, and put the ring into
his friend&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belonged to royalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Mary, Queen of Scots.&nbsp; It was given to her by a
man, a foreigner, with other things from Italy.&nbsp; It came from Naples.&nbsp;
It is not in the old setting.&nbsp; She wore it only once.&nbsp; The
person who gave it to her was a musician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seer then &ldquo;saw&rdquo; the donor&rsquo;s signature, &ldquo;Rizzio&rdquo;.&nbsp;
But Rizzio spelled his name Riccio!&nbsp; The seer now copied on paper
a writing which in his trance he saw on vellum.&nbsp; The design here
engraved (p. 32) is only from a rough copy of the seer&rsquo;s original
drawing, which was made by Major Buckley.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

</a>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rdquo; (pointing to the middle) &ldquo;I see a diamond
cross.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smallest stone was above the size of one
of four carats.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rdquo; (the cross) &ldquo;was worn out
of sight by Mary.&nbsp; The vellum has been shown in the House of Lords.&rdquo;
<a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31">{31}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo; . . . The ring was taken off Mary&rsquo;s finger by a man
in anger and jealousy: he threw it into the water.&nbsp; When he took
it off, she was being carried in a kind of bed with curtains&rdquo;
(a litter).</p>
<p>Just before Rizzio&rsquo;s murder Mary was <i>enceinte</i>, and might
well be carried in a litter, though she usually rode.</p>
<p>The seer then had a view of Sizzle&rsquo;s murder, which he had probably
read about.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, in another trance, the seer finished his design
of the vellum.&nbsp; The words</p>
<blockquote><p>A<br />
M<br />
DE LA PART</p>
</blockquote>
<p>probably stand for <i>&agrave; Marie</i>, <i>de la part de&mdash;</i></p>
<p>The thistle heads and leaves in gold at the corners were a usual
decoration of the period; compare the ceiling of the room in Edinburgh
Castle where James VI. was born, four months after Rizzio&rsquo;s murder.&nbsp;
They also occur in documents.&nbsp; Dr. Gregory conjectures that so
valuable a present as a diamond cross may have been made not by Rizzio,
but through Rizzio by the Pope.</p>
<p>It did not seem good to the doctor to consult Mary&rsquo;s lists
of jewels, nor, if he had done so, would he have been any the wiser.&nbsp;
In 1566, just before the birth of James VI., Mary had an inventory drawn
up, and added the names of the persons to whom she bequeathed her treasures
in case she died in child-bed.&nbsp; But this inventory, hidden among
a mass of law-papers in the Record Office, was not discovered till 1854,
nine years after the vision of 1845, and three after its publication
by Dr. Gregory in 1851.&nbsp; Not till 1863 was the inventory of 1566,
discovered in 1854, published for the Bannatyne Club by Dr. Joseph Robertson.</p>
<p>Turning to the inventory we read of a valuable present made by David
Rizzio to Mary, a tortoise of rubies, which she kept till her death,
for it appears in a list made after her execution at Fotheringay.&nbsp;
The murdered David Rizzio left a brother Joseph.&nbsp; Him the queen
made her secretary, and in her will of 1566 mentions him thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A Josef</i>, <i>pour porter &agrave; celui qui je luy ay
dit</i>, une emeraude emaille de blanc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A Josef</i>, <i>pour porter &agrave; celui qui je luy ai
dit</i>, <i>dont il ranvoir quittance.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Une bague garnye de vingt cinq diamens tant grands que petis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the diamond cross seen by the young officer in 1845 was set with
diamonds great and small, and was, in his opinion, a gift from or through
Rizzio.&nbsp; &ldquo;The queen wore it out of sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
in the inventory we have a <i>bague</i> (which may be a cross) of diamonds
small and great, connected with a secret only known to Rizzio&rsquo;s
brother and to the queen.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;to be carried to one whose
name the queen has spoken in her new secretary&rsquo;s ear&rdquo; (Joseph&rsquo;s),
&ldquo;but dare not trust herself to write&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would
be idle now to seek to pry into the mystery which was thus anxiously
guarded,&rdquo; says Dr. Robertson, editor of the queen&rsquo;s inventories.&nbsp;
The doctor knew nothing of the vision which, perhaps, so nearly pried
into the mystery.&nbsp; There is nothing like proof here, but there
is just a presumption that the diamonds connected with Rizzio, and secretly
worn by the queen, seen in the vision of 1845, are possibly the diamonds
which, had Mary died in 1566, were to be carried by Joseph Rizzio to
a person whose name might not safely be written. <a name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a">{35a}</a></p>
<p>We now take a dream which apparently reveals a real fact occurring
at a distance.&nbsp; It is translated from Brierre de Boismont&rsquo;s
book, <i>Des Hallucinations</i> <a name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b">{35b}</a>
(Paris, 1845).&nbsp; &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; says the learned author,
&ldquo;authentic dreams which have revealed an event occurring at the
moment, or later.&rdquo;&nbsp; These he explains by accidental coincidence,
and then gives the following anecdote, as within his own intimate knowledge:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE DEATHBED</h3>
<p>Miss C., a lady of excellent sense, religious but not bigoted, lived
before her marriage in the house of her uncle D., a celebrated physician,
and member of the Institute.&nbsp; Her mother at this time was seriously
ill in the country.&nbsp; One night the girl dreamed that she saw her
mother, pale and dying, and especially grieved at the absence of two
of her children: one a <i>cur&eacute;</i> in Spain, the other&mdash;herself&mdash;in
Paris.&nbsp; Next she heard her own Christian name called, &ldquo;Charlotte!&rdquo;
and, in her dream, saw the people about her mother bring in her own
little niece and god-child Charlotte from the next room.&nbsp; The patient
intimated by a sign that she did not want <i>this</i> Charlotte, but
her daughter in Paris.&nbsp; She displayed the deepest regret; her countenance
changed, she fell back, and died.</p>
<p>Next day the melancholy of Mademoiselle C. attracted the attention
of her uncle.&nbsp; She told him her dream; he pressed her to his heart,
and admitted that her mother was dead.</p>
<p>Some months later Mademoiselle C., when her uncle was absent, arranged
his papers, which he did not like any one to touch.&nbsp; Among these
was a letter containing the story of her mother&rsquo;s death, with
all the details of her own dream, which D. had kept concealed lest they
should impress her too painfully.</p>
<p>Boismont is staggered by this circumstance, and inclined to account
for it by &ldquo;still unknown relations in the moral and physical world&rdquo;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mental telegraphy,&rdquo; of course, would explain all, and even
chance coincidence is perfectly conceivable.</p>
<p>The most commonly known of dreams prior to, or simultaneous with
an historical occurrence represented in the vision, is Mr. Williams&rsquo;s
dream of the murder of Mr. Perceval in the lobby of the House of Commons,
May 11, 1812.&nbsp; Mr. Williams, of Scorrier House, near Redruth, in
Cornwall, lived till 1841.&nbsp; He was interested in mines, and a man
of substance.&nbsp; Unluckily the versions of his dream are full of
discrepancies.&nbsp; It was first published, apparently, in <i>The Times</i>
during the &ldquo;silly season&rdquo; of 1828 (August 28).&nbsp; According
to <i>The Times</i>, whose account is very minute, Mr. Williams dreamed
of the murder thrice before 2 a.m. on the night of May 11.&nbsp; He
told Mrs. Williams, and was so disturbed that he rose and dressed at
two in the morning.&nbsp; He went to Falmouth next day (May 12), and
told the tale to every one he knew.&nbsp; On the evening of the 13th
he told it to Mr. and Mrs. Tucker (his married daughter) of Tremanton
Castle.&nbsp; Mr. Williams only knew that the <i>chancellor</i> was
shot; Mr. Tucker said it must be the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&nbsp;
From the description he recognised Mr. Perceval, with whom he was at
enmity.&nbsp; Mr. Williams had never been inside the House of Commons.&nbsp;
As they talked, Mr. William&rsquo;s son galloped up from Truro with
news of the murder, got from a traveller by coach.&nbsp; Six weeks later,
Mr. Williams went to town, and in the House of Commons walked up to
and recognised the scene of the various incidents in the murder.</p>
<p>So far <i>The Times</i>, in 1828.&nbsp; But two forms of a version
of 1832 exist, one in a note to Mr. Walpole&rsquo;s <i>Life of Perceval</i>
(1874), &ldquo;an attested statement, drawn up and signed by Mr. Williams
in the presence of the Rev. Thomas Fisher and Mr. Charles Prideaux Brune&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Mr. Brune gave it to Mr. Walpole.&nbsp; With only verbal differences
this variant corresponds to another signed by Mr. Williams and given
by him to his grandson, who gave it to Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s great-niece,
by whom it was lent to the Society for Psychical Research.</p>
<p>These accounts differ <i>toto c&oelig;lo</i> from that in <i>The
Times</i> of 1828.&nbsp; The dream is <i>not</i> of May 11, but &ldquo;about&rdquo;
May 2 or 3.&nbsp; Mr. Williams is <i>not</i> a stranger to the House
of Commons; it is &ldquo;a place well known to me&rdquo;.&nbsp; He is
<i>not</i> ignorant of the name of the victim, but &ldquo;understood
that it was Mr. Perceval&rdquo;.&nbsp; He thinks of going to town to
give warning.&nbsp; We hear nothing of Mr. Tucker.&nbsp; Mr. Williams
does <i>not</i> verify his dream in the House, but from a drawing.&nbsp;
A Mr. C. R. Fox, son of one to whom the dream was told <i>before</i>
the event, was then a boy of fourteen, and sixty-one years later was
sure that he himself heard of Mr. Williams&rsquo;s dream <i>before</i>
the news of the murder arrived.&nbsp; After sixty years, however, the
memory cannot be relied upon.</p>
<p>One very curious circumstance in connection with the assassination
of Mr. Perceval has never been noticed.&nbsp; A rumour or report of
the deed reached Bude Kirk, a village near Annan, on the night of Sunday,
May 10, a day before the crime was committed!&nbsp; This was stated
in the <i>Dumfries and Galloway Courier</i>, and copied in <i>The Times</i>
of May 25.&nbsp; On May 28, the <i>Perth Courier</i> quotes the Dumfries
paper, and adds that &ldquo;the Rev. Mr. Yorstoun, minister of Hoddam
(<i>ob</i>. 1833), has visited Bude Kirk and has obtained the most satisfactory
proof of the rumour having existed&rdquo; on May 10, but the rumour
cannot be traced to its source.&nbsp; Mr. Yorstoun authorises the mention
of his name.&nbsp; <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> of June 2 says that &ldquo;the
report is without foundation&rdquo;.&nbsp; If Williams talked everywhere
of his dream, on May 3, some garbled shape of it may conceivably have
floated to Bude Kirk by May 10, and originated the rumour.&nbsp; Whoever
started it would keep quiet when the real news arrived for fear of being
implicated in a conspiracy as accessory before the fact.&nbsp; No trace
of Mr. Williams&rsquo;s dream occurs in the contemporary London papers.</p>
<p>The best version of the dream to follow is probably that signed by
Mr. Williams himself in 1832. <a name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a">{39a}</a></p>
<p>It may, of course, be argued by people who accept Mr. Williams&rsquo;s
dream as a revelation of the future that it reached his mind from the
<i>purpose</i> conceived in Bellingham&rsquo;s mind, by way of &ldquo;mental
telegraphy&rdquo;. <a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b">{39b}</a></p>
<h3>DREAM OF MR.&nbsp; PERCEVAL&rsquo;S MURDER</h3>
<p>&ldquo;SUNDHILL, <i>December</i>, 1832.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Some account of a dream which occurred to John Williams,
Esq., of Scorrier House, in the county of Cornwall, in the year 1812.&nbsp;
Taken from his own mouth, and narrated by him at various times to several
of his friends.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being desired to write out the particulars of a remarkable
dream which I had in the year 1812, before I do so I think it may be
proper for me to say that at that time my attention was fully occupied
with affairs of my own&mdash;the superintendence of some very extensive
mines in Cornwall being entrusted to me.&nbsp; Thus I had no leisure
to pay any attention to political matters, and hardly knew at that time
who formed the administration of the country.&nbsp; It was, therefore,
scarcely possible that my own interest in the subject should have had
any share in suggesting the circumstances which presented themselves
to my imagination.&nbsp; It was, in truth, a subject which never occurred
to my waking thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dream was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the second or third day of May, 1812, I dreamed that
I was in the lobby of the House of Commons (a place well known to me).&nbsp;
A small man, dressed in a blue coat and a white waistcoat, entered,
and immediately I saw a person whom I had observed on my first entrance,
dressed in a snuff-coloured coat with metal buttons, take a pistol from
under his coat and present it at the little man above-mentioned.&nbsp;
The pistol was discharged, and the ball entered under the left breast
of the person at whom it was directed.&nbsp; I saw the blood issue from
the place where the ball had struck him, his countenance instantly altered,
and he fell to the ground.&nbsp; Upon inquiry who the sufferer might
be, I was informed that he was the chancellor.&nbsp; I understood him
to be Mr. Perceval, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer.&nbsp; I further
saw the murderer laid hold of by several of the gentlemen in the room.&nbsp;
Upon waking I told the particulars above related to my wife; she treated
the matter lightly, and desired me to go to sleep, saying it was only
a dream.&nbsp; I soon fell asleep again, and again the dream presented
itself with precisely the same circumstances.&nbsp; After waking a second
time and stating the matter again to my wife, she only repeated her
request that I would compose myself and dismiss the subject from my
mind.&nbsp; Upon my falling asleep the third time, the same dream without
any alteration was repeated, and I awoke, as on the former occasions,
in great agitation.&nbsp; So much alarmed and impressed was I with the
circumstances above related, that I felt much doubt whether it was not
my duty to take a journey to London and communicate upon the subject
with the party principally concerned.&nbsp; Upon this point I consulted
with some friends whom I met on business at the Godolphin mine on the
following day.&nbsp; After having stated to them the particulars of
the dream itself and what were my own feelings in relation to it, they
dissuaded me from my purpose, saying I might expose myself to contempt
and vexation, or be taken up as a fanatic.&nbsp; Upon this I said no
more, but anxiously watched the newspapers every evening as the post
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the evening of the 13th of May (as far as I recollect)
no account of Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s death was in the newspapers, but
my second son, returning from Truro, came in a hurried manner into the
room where I was sitting and exclaimed: &lsquo;O father, your dream
has come true!&nbsp; Mr. Perceval has been shot in the lobby of the
House of Commons; there is an account come from London to Truro written
after the newspapers were printed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact was Mr. Percival was assassinated on the evening
of the 11th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some business soon after called me to London, and in one of
the print-shops I saw a drawing for sale, representing the place and
the circumstances which attended Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I
purchased it, and upon a careful examination I found it to coincide
in all respects with the scene which had passed through my imagination
in the dream.&nbsp; The colours of the dresses, the buttons of the assassin&rsquo;s
coat, the white waistcoat of Mr. Perceval, the spot of blood upon it,
the countenances and attitudes of the parties present were exactly what
I had dreamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The singularity of the case, when mentioned among my friends
and acquaintances, naturally made it the subject of conversation in
London, and in consequence my friend, the late Mr. Rennie, was requested
by some of the commissioners of the navy that they might be permitted
to hear the circumstances from myself.&nbsp; Two of them accordingly
met me at Mr. Rennie&rsquo;s house, and to them I detailed at the time
the particulars, then fresh in my memory, which form the subject of
the above statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbear to make any comment on the above narrative, further
than to declare solemnly that it is a faithful account of facts as they
actually occurred.</p>
<p>(Signed) &ldquo;JOHN WILLIAMS.&rdquo; <a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42">{42}</a></p>
<p>When we come to dreams of the future, great historical examples are
scarce indeed, that is, dreams respectably authenticated.&nbsp; We have
to put up with curious trivialities.&nbsp; One has an odd feature.</p>
<h3>THE RATTLESNAKE</h3>
<p>Dr. Kinsolving, of the Church of the Epiphany in Philadelphia, dreamed
that he &ldquo;came across a rattlesnake,&rdquo; which &ldquo;when killed
had <i>two</i> black-looking rattles and a peculiar projection of bone
from the tail, while the skin was unusually light in colour&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Next day, while walking with his brother, Dr. Kinsolving nearly trod
on a rattlesnake, &ldquo;the same snake in every particular with the
one I had had in my mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo;.&nbsp; This would be very
well, but Dr. Kinsolving&rsquo;s brother, who helped to kill the unlucky
serpent, says &ldquo;<i>he had a single rattle</i>&rdquo;.&nbsp; The
letters of these gentlemen were written without communication to each
other.&nbsp; If Mr. Kinsolving is right, the real snake with <i>one</i>
rattle was <i>not</i> the dream snake with <i>two</i> rattles.&nbsp;
The brothers were in a snaky country, West Virginia. <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43">{43}</a></p>
<p>The following is trivial, but good.&nbsp; It is written by Mr. Alfred
Cooper, and attested by the dreamer, the Duchess of Hamilton.</p>
<h3>THE RED LAMP</h3>
<p>Mr. Cooper says: &ldquo;A fortnight before the death of the late
Earl of L--- in 1882, I called upon the Duke of Hamilton, in Hill Street,
to see him professionally.&nbsp; After I had finished seeing him, we
went into the drawing-room, where the duchess was, and the duke said,
&lsquo;Oh, Cooper, how is the earl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duchess said, &lsquo;What earl?&rsquo; and on my answering
&lsquo;Lord L---,&rsquo; she replied: &lsquo;That is very odd.&nbsp;
I have had a most extraordinary vision.&nbsp; I went to bed, but after
being in bed a short time, I was not exactly asleep, but thought I saw
a scene as if from a play before me.&nbsp; The actors in it were Lord
L--- as if in a fit, with a man standing over him with a red beard.&nbsp;
He was by the side of a bath, over which a red lamp was distinctly shown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then said: &lsquo;I am attending Lord L--- at present; there
is very little the matter with him; he is not going to die; he will
be all right very soon&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well he got better for a week and was nearly well, but at
the end of six or seven days after this I was called to see him suddenly.&nbsp;
He had inflammation of both lungs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called in Sir William Jenner, but in six days he was a dead
man.&nbsp; There were two male nurses attending on him; one had been
taken ill.&nbsp; But when I saw the other, the dream of the duchess
was exactly represented.&nbsp; He was standing near a bath over the
earl, and strange to say, his beard was red.&nbsp; There was the bath
with the red lamp over it.&nbsp; It is rather rare to find a bath with
a red lamp over it, and this brought the story to my mind. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>This account, written in 1888, has been revised by the late Duke
of Manchester, father of the Duchess of Hamilton, who heard the vision
from his daughter on the morning after she had seen it.</p>
<p>The duchess only knew the earl by sight, and had not heard that he
was ill.&nbsp; She knew she was not asleep, for she opened her eyes
to get rid of the vision, and, shutting them, saw the same thing again.
<a name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a">{45a}</a></p>
<p>In fact, the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; was an <i>illusion hypnagogique</i>.&nbsp;
Probably most readers know the procession of visions which sometimes
crowd on the closed eyes just before sleep. <a name="citation45b"></a><a href="#footnote45b">{45b}</a>&nbsp;
They commonly represent with vivid clearness unknown faces or places,
occasionally known faces.&nbsp; The writer has seen his own in this
way and has occasionally &ldquo;opened his eyes to get rid of&rdquo;
the appearances.&nbsp; In his opinion the pictures are unconsciously
constructed by the half-sleeping mind out of blurs of light or dark
seen with closed eyes.&nbsp; Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s story would be more
complete if he had said whether or not the earl, when visited by him,
was in a chair as in the vision.&nbsp; But beds are not commonly found
in bathrooms.</p>
<h3>THE SCAR IN THE MOUSTACHE</h3>
<p>This story was told to the writer by his old head-master, the Rev.
Dr. Hodson, brother of Hodson, of Hodson&rsquo;s Horse, a person whom
I never heard make any other allusion to such topics.&nbsp; Dr. Hodson
was staying with friends in Switzerland during the holidays.&nbsp; One
morning, as he lay awake, he seemed to see into a room as if the wall
of his bedroom had been cut out.&nbsp; In the room were a lady well
known to him and a man whom he did not know.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s back
was turned to the looker-on.&nbsp; The scene vanished, and grew again.&nbsp;
Now the man faced Dr. Hodson; the face was unfamiliar, and had a deep
white scar seaming the moustache.&nbsp; Dr. Hodson mentioned the circumstance
to his friends, and thought little of it.&nbsp; He returned home, and,
one day, in Perth station, met the lady at the book-stall.&nbsp; He
went up to accost her, and was surprised by the uneasiness of her manner.&nbsp;
A gentleman now joined them, with a deep white scar through his moustache.&nbsp;
Dr. Hodson now recalled, what had slipped his memory, that the lady
during his absence from Scotland had eloped with an officer, the man
of the vision and the railway station.&nbsp; He did not say, or perhaps
know, whether the elopement was prior to the kind of dream in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Here is a dream representing a future event, with details which could
not be guessed beforehand.</p>
<h3>THE CORAL SPRIGS</h3>
<p>Mrs. Weiss, of St. Louis, was in New York in January, 1881, attending
a daughter, Mrs. C., who was about to have a child.&nbsp; She writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Friday night (Jan. 21) I dreamed that my daughter&rsquo;s
time came; that owing to some cause not clearly defined, we failed to
get word to Mr. C., who was to bring the doctor; that we sent for the
nurse, who came; that as the hours passed and neither Mr. C. nor the
doctor came we both got frightened; that at last I heard Mr. C. on the
stairs, and cried to him: &lsquo;Oh, Chan, for heaven&rsquo;s sake get
a doctor!&nbsp; Ada may be confined at any moment&rsquo;; that he rushed
away, and I returned to the bedside of my daughter, who was in agony
of mind and body; that suddenly I seemed to know what to do, . . . and
that shortly after Mr. C. came, bringing a tall young doctor, having
brown eyes, dark hair, ruddy <i>brun</i> complexion, grey trousers and
grey vest, and wearing a bright blue cravat, picked out with coral sprigs;
the cravat attracted my attention particularly.&nbsp; The young doctor
pronounced Mrs. C. properly attended to, and left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weiss at breakfast told the dream to Mr. C. and her daughter;
none of them attached any importance to it.&nbsp; However, as a snowstorm
broke the telegraph wires on Saturday, the day after the dream, Mrs.
Weiss was uneasy.&nbsp; On Tuesday the state of Mrs. C. demanded a doctor.&nbsp;
Mrs. Weiss sent a telegram for Mr. C.; he came at last, went out to
bring a doctor, and was long absent.&nbsp; Then Mrs. Weiss suddenly
felt a calm certainty that <i>she</i> (though inexperienced in such
cares) could do what was needed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard myself say in
a peremptory fashion: &lsquo;Ada, don&rsquo;t be afraid, I know just
what to do; all will go well&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; All did go well; meanwhile
Mr. C. ran to seven doctors&rsquo; houses, and at last returned with
a young man whom Mrs. Weiss vaguely recognised.&nbsp; Mrs. C. whispered,
&ldquo;Look at the doctor&rsquo;s cravat&rdquo;.&nbsp; It was blue and
coral sprigged, and then first did Mrs. Weiss remember her dream of
Friday night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weiss&rsquo;s story is corroborated by Mr. Blanchard, who heard
the story &ldquo;a few days after the event&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mrs. C. has
read Mrs. Weiss&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;and in so far as I can remember
it is quite correct&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mr. C. remembers nothing about it;
&ldquo;he declares that he has no recollection of it, <i>or of any matters
outside his business</i>, and knowing him as I do,&rdquo; says Mrs.
Weiss, &ldquo;I do not doubt the assertion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. C. must be an interesting companion.&nbsp; The nurse remembers
that after the birth of the baby Mrs. C. called Mr. C.&rsquo;s attention
to &ldquo;the doctor&rsquo;s necktie,&rdquo; and heard her say, &ldquo;Why,
I know him by mamma&rsquo;s description as the doctor she saw in her
dreams&rdquo;. <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48">{48}</a></p>
<p>The only thing even more extraordinary than the dream is Mr. C.&rsquo;s
inability to remember anything whatever &ldquo;outside of his business&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Another witness appears to decline to be called, &ldquo;as it would
be embarrassing to him in his business&rdquo;.&nbsp; This it is to be
Anglo-Saxon!</p>
<p>We now turn to a Celtic dream, in which knowledge supposed to be
only known to a dead man was conveyed to his living daughter.</p>
<h3>THE SATIN SLIPPERS</h3>
<p>On 1st February, 1891, Michael Conley, a farmer living near Ionia,
in Chichasow county, Iowa, went to Dubuque, in Iowa, to be medically
treated.&nbsp; He left at home his son Pat and his daughter Elizabeth,
a girl of twenty-eight, a Catholic, in good health.&nbsp; On February
3 Michael was found dead in an outhouse near his inn.&nbsp; In his pocket
were nine dollars, seventy-five cents, but his clothes, including his
shirt, were thought so dirty and worthless that they were thrown away.&nbsp;
The body was then dressed in a white shirt, black clothes and satin
slippers of a new pattern.&nbsp; Pat Conley was telegraphed for, and
arrived at Dubuque on February 4, accompanied by Mr. George Brown, &ldquo;an
intelligent and reliable farmer&rdquo;.&nbsp; Pat took the corpse home
in a coffin, and on his arrival Elizabeth fell into a swoon, which lasted
for several hours.&nbsp; Her own account of what followed on her recovery
may be given in her own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they told me that father was dead I felt very sick and
bad; I did not know anything.&nbsp; Then father came to me.&nbsp; He
had on a white shirt&rdquo; (his own was grey), &ldquo;and black clothes
and slippers.&nbsp; When I came to, I told Pat I had seen father.&nbsp;
I asked Pat if he had brought back father&rsquo;s old clothes.&nbsp;
He said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and asked me why I wanted them.&nbsp; I told
him father said he had sewed a roll of bills inside of his grey shirt,
in a pocket made of a piece of my old red dress.&nbsp; I went to sleep,
and father came to me again.&nbsp; When I awoke I told Pat he must go
and get the clothes&rdquo;&mdash;her father&rsquo;s old clothes.</p>
<p>Pat now telephoned to Mr. Hoffman, Coroner of Dubuque, who found
the old clothes in the back yard of the local morgue.&nbsp; They were
wrapped up in a bundle.&nbsp; Receiving this news, Pat went to Dubuque
on February 9, where Mr. Hoffman opened the bundle in Pat&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp;
Inside the old grey shirt was found a pocket of red stuff, sewn with
a man&rsquo;s long, uneven stitches, and in the pocket notes for thirty-five
dollars.</p>
<p>The girl did not see the body in the coffin, but asked about the
<i>old</i> clothes, because the figure of her father in her dream wore
clothes which she did not recognise as his.&nbsp; To dream in a faint
is nothing unusual. <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50">{50}</a></p>
<h3>THE DEAD SHOPMAN</h3>
<p>Swooning, or slight mental mistiness, is not very unusual in ghost
seers.&nbsp; The brother of a friend of my own, a man of letters and
wide erudition, was, as a boy, employed in a shop in a town, say Wexington.&nbsp;
The overseer was a dark, rather hectic-looking man, who died.&nbsp;
Some months afterwards the boy was sent on an errand.&nbsp; He did his
business, but, like a boy, returned by a longer and more interesting
route.&nbsp; He stopped as a bookseller&rsquo;s shop to stare at the
books and pictures, and while doing so felt a kind of mental vagueness.&nbsp;
It was just before his dinner hour, and he may have been hungry.&nbsp;
On resuming his way, he looked up and found the dead overseer beside
him.&nbsp; He had no sense of surprise, and walked for some distance,
conversing on ordinary topics with the appearance.&nbsp; He happened
to notice such a minute detail as that the spectre&rsquo;s boots were
laced in an unusual way.&nbsp; At a crossing, something in the street
attracted his attention; he looked away from his companion, and, on
turning to resume their talk, saw no more of him.&nbsp; He then walked
to the shop, where he mentioned the occurrence to a friend.&nbsp; He
has never during a number of years had any such experience again, or
suffered the preceding sensation of vagueness.</p>
<p>This, of course, is not a ghost story, but leads up to the old tale
of the wraith of Valogne.&nbsp; In this case, two boys had made a covenant,
the first who died was to appear to the other.&nbsp; He <i>did</i> appear
before news of his death arrived, but after a swoon of his friend&rsquo;s,
whose health (like that of Elizabeth Conley) suffered in consequence.</p>
<h3>NOTE</h3>
<p>&ldquo;PERCEVAL MURDER.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Times</i>, 25<i>th May</i>,
1812.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Dumfries paper states that on the night of Sunday, the 10th
instant, <i>twenty-four hours before the fatal deed was perpetrated</i>,
a report was brought to Bude Kirk, two miles from Annan, that <i>Mr.
Perceval was shot on his way to the House of Commons</i>, <i>at the
door or in the lobby of that House</i>.&nbsp; This the whole inhabitants
of the village are ready to attest, as the report quickly spread and
became the topic of conversation.&nbsp; A clergyman investigated the
rumour, with the view of tracing it to its source, but without success.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Times</i> of 2nd June says, &ldquo;Report without foundation&rdquo;.</p>
<p><i>Perth Courier</i>, 28th May, quoting from the <i>Dumfries and
Galloway Courier</i>, repeats above almost verbatim.&nbsp; &ldquo; .
. .&nbsp; The clergyman to whom we have alluded, and who allows me to
make use of his name, is Mr. Yorstoun, minister of Hoddam.&nbsp; This
gentleman went to the spot and carefully investigated the rumour, but
has not hitherto been successful, although he has obtained the most
satisfactory proof of its having existed at the time we have mentioned.&nbsp;
We forbear to make any comments on this wonderful circumstance, but
should anything further transpire that may tend to throw light upon
it, we shall not fail to give the public earliest information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From dreams, in sleep or swoon, of a character difficult to believe
in we pass by way of &ldquo;hallucinations&rdquo; to ghosts.&nbsp; Everybody
is ready to admit that dreams do really occur, because almost everybody
has dreamed.&nbsp; But everybody is not so ready to admit that sane
and sensible men and women can have hallucinations, just because everybody
has not been hallucinated.</p>
<p>On this point Mr. Francis Galton, in his <i>Inquiries into Human
Faculty</i> (1833), is very instructive.&nbsp; Mr. Galton drew up a
short catechism, asking people how clearly or how dimly they saw things
&ldquo;in their mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of your breakfast-table,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;is your
mental picture of it as clearly illuminated and as complete as your
actual view of the scene?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Galton began by questioning
friends in the scientific world, F.R.S.&rsquo;s and other <i>savants</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The earliest results of my inquiry amazed me. . . .&nbsp; The
great majority of the men of science to whom I first applied, protested
that <i>mental imagery was unknown to them</i>, and they looked on me
as fanciful and fantastic in supposing that the words &lsquo;mental
imagery&rsquo; really expressed what I believed everybody supposed them
to mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; One gentleman wrote: &ldquo;It is only by a figure
of speech that I can describe my recollection of a scene as a &lsquo;mental
image&rsquo; which I can &lsquo;see&rsquo; with &lsquo;my mind&rsquo;s
eye&rsquo;.&nbsp; I do not see it,&rdquo; so he seems to have supposed
that nobody else did.</p>
<p>When he made inquiries in general society, Mr. Galton found plenty
of people who &ldquo;saw&rdquo; mental imagery with every degree of
brilliance or dimness, from &ldquo;quite comparable to the real object&rdquo;
to &ldquo;I recollect the table, but do not see it&rdquo;&mdash;my own
position.</p>
<p>Mr. Galton was next &ldquo;greatly struck by the frequency of the
replies in which my correspondents&rdquo; (sane and healthy) &ldquo;described
themselves as subject to &lsquo;visions&rsquo;&rdquo;.&nbsp; These varied
in degree, &ldquo;some were so vivid as actually to deceive the judgment&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Finally, &ldquo;a notable proportion of sane persons have had not only
visions, but actual hallucinations of sight at one or more periods of
their life.&nbsp; I have a considerable packet of instances contributed
by my personal friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus one &ldquo;distinguished authoress&rdquo;
saw &ldquo;the principal character of one of her novels glide through
the door straight up to her.&nbsp; It was about the size of a large
doll.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another heard unreal music, and opened the door to
hear it better.&nbsp; Another was plagued by voices, which said &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo;
and so forth.</p>
<p>Thus, on scientific evidence, sane and healthy people may, and &ldquo;in
a notable proportion <i>do</i>, experience hallucinations&rdquo;.&nbsp;
That is to say, they see persons, or hear them, or believe they are
touched by them, or all their senses are equally affected at once, when
no such persons are really present.&nbsp; This kind of thing is always
going on, but &ldquo;when popular opinion is of a matter-of-fact kind,
the seers of visions keep quiet; they do not like to be thought fanciful
or mad, and they hide their experiences, which only come to light through
inquiries such as those that I have been making&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We may now proceed to the waking hallucinations of sane and healthy
people, which Mr. Galton declares to be so far from uncommon.&nbsp;
Into the <i>causes</i> of these hallucinations which may actually deceive
the judgment, Mr. Galton does not enter.</p>
<h3>STORY OF THE DIPLOMATIST <a name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a">{56a}</a></h3>
<p>For example, there is a living diplomatist who knows men and cities,
and has, moreover, a fine sense of humour.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo;
said a famous Russian statesman to him, &ldquo;you have all the qualities
of a diplomatist, but you cannot control your smile.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
gentleman, walking alone in a certain cloister at Cambridge, met a casual
acquaintance, a well-known London clergyman, and was just about shaking
hands with him, when the clergyman vanished.&nbsp; Nothing in particular
happened to either of them; the clergyman was not in the seer&rsquo;s
mind at the moment.</p>
<p>This is a good example of a solitary hallucination in the experience
of a very cool-headed observer.&nbsp; The <i>causes</i> of such experiences
are still a mystery to science.&nbsp; Even people who believe in &ldquo;mental
telegraphy,&rdquo; say when a distant person, at death or in any other
crisis, impresses himself as present on the senses of a friend, cannot
account for an experience like that of the diplomatist, an experience
not very uncommon, and little noticed except when it happens to coincide
with some remarkable event. <a name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b">{56b}</a>&nbsp;
Nor are such hallucinations of an origin easily detected, like those
of delirium, insanity, intoxication, grief, anxiety, or remorse.&nbsp;
We can only suppose that a past impression of the aspect of a friend
is recalled by some association of ideas so vividly that (though we
are not <i>consciously</i> thinking of him) we conceive the friend to
be actually present in the body when he is absent.</p>
<p>These hallucinations are casual and unsought.&nbsp; But between these
and the dreams of sleep there is a kind of waking hallucinations which
some people can purposely evoke.&nbsp; Such are the visions of <i>crystal
gazing.</i></p>
<p>Among the superstitions of almost all ages and countries is the belief
that &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; will show themselves, usually after magical
ceremonies, to certain persons, commonly children, who stare into a
crystal ball, a cup, a mirror, a blob of ink (in Egypt and India), a
drop of blood (among the Maoris of New Zealand), a bowl of water (Red
Indian), a pond (Roman and African), water in a glass bowl (in Fez),
or almost any polished surface.&nbsp; The magical ceremonies, which
have probably nothing to do with the matter, have succeeded in making
this old and nearly universal belief seem a mere fantastic superstition.&nbsp;
But occasionally a person not superstitious has recorded this experience.&nbsp;
Thus George Sand in her <i>Histoire de ma Vie</i> mentions that, as
a little girl, she used to see wonderful moving landscapes in the polished
back of a screen.&nbsp; These were so vivid that she thought they must
be visible to others.</p>
<p>Recent experiments have proved that an unexpected number of people
have this faculty.&nbsp; Gazing into a ball of crystal or glass, a crystal
or other smooth ring stone, such as a sapphire or ruby, or even into
a common ink-pot, they will see visions very brilliant.&nbsp; These
are often mere reminiscences of faces or places, occasionally of faces
or places sunk deep below the ordinary memory.&nbsp; Still more frequently
they represent fantastic landscapes and romantic scenes, as in an historical
novel, with people in odd costumes coming, going and acting.&nbsp; Thus
I have been present when a lady saw in a glass ball a man in white Oriental
costume kneeling beside a leaping fountain of fire.&nbsp; Presently
a hand appeared pointing downwards through the flame.&nbsp; The <i>first</i>
vision seen pretty often represents an invalid in bed.&nbsp; Printed
words are occasionally read in the glass, as also happens in the visions
beheld with shut eyes before sleeping.</p>
<p>All these kinds of things, in fact, are common in our visions between
sleeping and waking (<i>illusions hypnagogiques</i>).&nbsp; The singularity
is that they are seen by people wide awake in glass balls and so forth.&nbsp;
Usually the seer is a person whose ordinary &ldquo;mental imagery&rdquo;
is particularly vivid.&nbsp; But every &ldquo;visualiser&rdquo; is not
a crystal seer.&nbsp; A novelist of my acquaintance can &ldquo;visualise&rdquo;
so well that, having forgotten an address and lost the letter on which
it was written, he called up a mental picture of the letter, and so
discovered the address.&nbsp; But this very popular writer can see no
visions in a crystal ball.&nbsp; Another very popular novelist can see
them; little dramas are acted out in the ball for his edification. <a name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58">{58}</a></p>
<p>These things are as unfamiliar to men of science as Mr. Galton found
ordinary mental imagery, pictures in memory, to be.&nbsp; Psychology
may or may not include them in her province; they may or may not come
to be studied as ordinary dreams are studied.&nbsp; But, like dreams,
these crystal visions enter the domain of the ghostly only when they
are <i>veracious</i>, and contribute information previously unknown
as to past, present or future.&nbsp; There are plenty of stories to
this effect.&nbsp; To begin with an easy, or comparatively easy, exercise
in belief.</p>
<h3>UNDER THE LAMP</h3>
<p>I had given a glass ball to a young lady, who believed that she could
play the &ldquo;willing game&rdquo; successfully without touching the
person &ldquo;willed,&rdquo; and when the person did not even know that
&ldquo;willing&rdquo; was going on.&nbsp; This lady, Miss Baillie, had
scarcely any success with the ball.&nbsp; She lent it to Miss Leslie,
who saw a large, square, old-fashioned red sofa covered with muslin,
which she found in the next country house she visited.&nbsp; Miss Baillie&rsquo;s
brother, a young athlete (at short odds for the amateur golf championship),
laughed at these experiments, took the ball into the study, and came
back looking &ldquo;gey gash&rdquo;.&nbsp; He admitted that he had seen
a vision, somebody he knew &ldquo;under a lamp&rdquo;.&nbsp; He would
discover during the week whether he saw right or not.&nbsp; This was
at 5.30 on a Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; On Tuesday, Mr. Baillie was at
a dance in a town some forty miles from his home, and met a Miss Preston.&nbsp;
&ldquo;On Sunday,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about half-past five you were
sitting under a standard lamp in a dress I never saw you wear, a blue
blouse with lace over the shoulders, pouring out tea for a man in blue
serge, whose back was towards me, so that I only saw the tip of his
moustache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the blinds must have been up,&rdquo; said Miss Preston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was at Dulby,&rdquo; said Mr. Baillie, as he undeniably
was. <a name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a">{60a}</a></p>
<p>This is not a difficult exercise in belief.&nbsp; Miss Preston was
not unlikely to be at tea at tea-time.</p>
<p>Nor is the following very hard.</p>
<h3>THE COW WITH THE BELL</h3>
<p>I had given a glass ball to the wife of a friend, whose visions proved
so startling and on one occasion so unholy that she ceased to make experiments.&nbsp;
One day my friend&rsquo;s secretary, a young student and golfer, took
up the ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a field I know very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
there is a cow in it that I never saw; brown, with white markings, and,
this is odd in Scotland, she has a bell hanging from her neck.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go and look at the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went and found the cow as described, bell and all. <a name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b">{60b}</a></p>
<p>In the spring of 1897 I gave a glass ball to a young lady, previously
a stranger to me, who was entirely unacquainted with crystal gazing,
even by report.&nbsp; She had, however, not infrequent experience of
spontaneous visions, which were fulfilled, including a vision of the
Derby (Persimmon&rsquo;s year), which enriched her friends.&nbsp; In
using the ball she, time after time, succeeded in seeing and correctly
describing persons and places familiar to people for whom she &ldquo;scried,&rdquo;
but totally strange to herself.&nbsp; In one case she added a detail
quite unknown to the person who consulted her, but which was verified
on inquiry.&nbsp; These experiments will probably be published elsewhere.&nbsp;
Four people, out of the very small number who tried on these occasions,
saw fancy pictures in the ball: two were young ladies, one a man, and
one a schoolboy.&nbsp; I must confess that, for the first time, I was
impressed by the belief that the lady&rsquo;s veracious visions, however
they are to be explained, could not possibly be accounted for by chance
coincidence.&nbsp; They were too many (I was aware of five in a few
days), too minute, and too remote from the range of ingenious guessing.&nbsp;
But &ldquo;thought transference,&rdquo; tapping the mental wires of
another person, would have accounted for every case, with, perhaps,
the exception of that in which an unknown detail was added.&nbsp; This
confession will, undoubtedly, seem weakly credulous, but not to make
it would be unfair and unsportsmanlike.&nbsp; My statement, of course,
especially without the details, is not evidence for other people.</p>
<p>The following case is a much harder exercise in belief.&nbsp; It
is narrated by the Duc de Saint Simon. <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62">{62}</a>&nbsp;
The events were described to Saint Simon on the day after their occurrence
by the Duc d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, then starting for Italy, in May,
1706.&nbsp; Saint Simon was very intimate with the duke, and they corresponded
by private cypher without secretaries.&nbsp; Owing to the death of the
king&rsquo;s son and grandson (not seen in the vision), Orl&eacute;ans
became Regent when Louis XIV. died in 1714.&nbsp; Saint Simon is a reluctant
witness, and therefore all the better.</p>
<h3>THE DEATHBED OF LOUIS XIV.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a strange story that the Duc d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
told me one day in a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> at Marly,
he having just run down from Paris before he started for Italy; and
it may be observed that all the events predicted came to pass, though
none of them could have been foreseen at the time.&nbsp; His interest
in every kind of art and science was very great, and in spite of his
keen intellect, he was all his life subject to a weakness which had
been introduced (with other things) from Italy by Catherine de Medici,
and had reigned supreme over the courts of her children.&nbsp; He had
exercised every known method of inducing the devil to appear to him
in person, though, as he has himself told me, without the smallest success.&nbsp;
He had spent much time in investigating matters that touched on the
supernatural, and dealt with the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now La Sery (his mistress) had in her house a little girl
of eight or nine years of age, who had never resided elsewhere since
her birth.&nbsp; She was to all appearance a very ordinary child, and
from the way in which she had been brought up, was more than commonly
ignorant and simple.&nbsp; One day, during the visit of M. d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans,
La Sery produced for his edification one of the charlatans with whom
the duke had long been familiar, who pretended that by means of a glass
of water he could see the answer to any question that might be put.&nbsp;
For this purpose it was necessary to have as a go-between some one both
young and innocent, to gaze into the water, and this little girl was
at once sent for.&nbsp; They amused themselves by asking what was happening
in certain distant places; and after the man had murmured some words
over the water, the child looked in and always managed to see the vision
required of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. le duc d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans had so often been duped in
matters of this kind that he determined to put the water-gazer to a
severe test.&nbsp; He whispered to one of his attendants to go round
to Madame de Nancre&rsquo;s, who lived close by, and ascertain who was
there, what they were all doing, the position of the room and the way
it was furnished, and then, without exchanging a word with any one,
to return and let him know the result.&nbsp; This was done speedily
and without the slightest suspicion on the part of any person, the child
remaining in the room all the time.&nbsp; When M. le duc d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
had learned all he wanted to know, he bade the child look in the water
and tell him who was at Madame de Nancre&rsquo;s and what they were
all doing.&nbsp; She repeated word for word the story that had been
told by the duke&rsquo;s messenger; described minutely the faces, dresses
and positions of the assembled company, those that were playing cards
at the various tables, those that were sitting, those that were standing,
even the very furniture!&nbsp; But to leave nothing in doubt, the Duke
of Orl&eacute;ans despatched Nancre back to the house to verify a second
time the child&rsquo;s account, and like the valet, he found she had
been right in every particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rule he said very little to me about these subjects,
as he knew I did not approve of them, and on this occasion I did not
fail to scold him, and to point out the folly of being amused by such
things, especially at a time when his attention should be occupied with
more serious matters.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, but I have only told you half,&rsquo;
he replied; &lsquo;that was just the beginning,&rsquo; and then he went
on to say that, encouraged by the exactitude of the little girl&rsquo;s
description of Madame de Nancre&rsquo;s room, he resolved to put to
her a more important question, namely, as to the scene that would occur
at the death of the king.&nbsp; The child had never seen any one who
was about the court, and had never even heard of Versailles, but she
described exactly and at great length the king&rsquo;s bedroom at Versailles
and all the furniture which was in fact there at the date of his death.&nbsp;
She gave every detail as to the bed, and cried out on recognising, in
the arms of Madame de Ventadour, a little child decorated with an order
whom she had seen at the house of Mademoiselle la Sery; and again at
the sight of M. le duc d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans.&nbsp; From her account,
Madame de Maintenon, Fagon with his odd face, Madame la duchesse d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans,
Madame la duchesse, Madame la princesse de Conti, besides other princes
and nobles, and even the valets and servants were all present at the
king&rsquo;s deathbed.&nbsp; Then she paused, and M. le duc d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans,
surprised that she had never mentioned Monseigneur, Monsieur le duc
de Bourgogne, Madame la duchesse de Bourgogne, nor M. le duc de Berri,
inquired if she did not see such and such people answering to their
description.&nbsp; She persisted that she did not, and went over the
others for the second time.&nbsp; This astonished M. le duc d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
deeply, as well as myself, and we were at a loss to explain it, but
the event proved that the child was perfectly right.&nbsp; This <i>s&eacute;ance</i>
took place in 1706.&nbsp; These four members of the royal family were
then full of health and strength; and they all died before the king.&nbsp;
It was the same thing with M. le prince, M. le duc, and M. le prince
de Conti, whom she likewise did not see, though she beheld the children
of the two last named; M. du Maine, his own (Orl&eacute;ans), and M.
le comte de Toulouse.&nbsp; But of course this fact was unknown till
eight years after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Science may conceivably come to study crystal visions, but veracious
crystal visions will be treated like veracious dreams.&nbsp; That is
to say, they will be explained as the results of a chance coincidence
between the unknown fact and the vision, or of imposture, conscious
or unconscious, or of confusion of memory, or the fact of the crystal
vision will be simply denied.&nbsp; Thus a vast number of well-authenticated
cases of veracious visions will be required before science could admit
that it might be well to investigate hitherto unacknowledged faculties
of the human mind.&nbsp; The evidence can never be other than the word
of the seer, with whatever value may attach to the testimony of those
for whom he &ldquo;sees,&rdquo; and describes, persons and places unknown
to himself.&nbsp; The evidence of individuals as to their own subjective
experiences is accepted by psychologists in other departments of the
study. <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66">{66}</a></p>

Death.&nbsp; Others not Coincident with Anything.</i></p>
<p>In &ldquo;crystal-gazing&rdquo; anybody can make experiments for
himself and among such friends as he thinks he can trust.&nbsp; They
are hallucinations consciously sought for, and as far as possible, provoked
or induced by taking certain simple measures.&nbsp; Unsought, spontaneous
waking hallucinations, according to the result of Mr. Galton&rsquo;s
researches, though not nearly so common as dreams, are as much facts
of <i>sane</i> mental experience.&nbsp; Now every ghost or wraith is
a hallucination.&nbsp; You see your wife in the dining-room when she
really is in the drawing-room; you see your late great-great-grandfather
anywhere.&nbsp; Neither person is really present.&nbsp; The first appearance
in popular language is a &ldquo;wraith&rdquo;; the second is a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo;
in ordinary speech.&nbsp; Both are hallucinations.</p>
<p>So far Mr. Galton would go, but mark what follows!&nbsp; Everybody
allows the existence of dreams, but comparatively few believe in dream
stories of <i>veracious</i> dreams.&nbsp; So every scientific man believes
in hallucinations, <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68">{68}</a>
but few believe in <i>veracious</i> hallucinations.&nbsp; A veracious
hallucination is, for our purpose, one which communicates (as veracious
dreams do) information not otherwise known, or, at least, not known
to the knower to be known.&nbsp; The communication of the knowledge
may be done by audible words, with or without an actual apparition,
or with an apparition, by words or gestures.&nbsp; Again, if a hallucination
of Jones&rsquo;s presence tallies with a great crisis in Jones&rsquo;s
life, or with his death, the hallucination is so far veracious in that,
at least, it does not seem meaningless.&nbsp; Or if Jones&rsquo;s appearance
has some unwonted feature not known to the seer, but afterwards proved
to be correct in fact, that is veracious.&nbsp; Next, if several persons
successively in the same place, or simultaneously, have a similar hallucination
not to be accounted for physically, that is, if not a veracious, a curious
hallucination.&nbsp; Once more, if a hallucinatory figure is afterwards
recognised in a living person previously unknown, or a portrait previously
unseen, that (if the recognition be genuine) is a veracious hallucination.&nbsp;
The vulgar call it a wraith of the living, or a ghost of the dead.</p>
<p>Here follow two cases.&nbsp; The first, <i>The Family Coach</i>,
<a name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a">{69a}</a> gave no verified
intelligence, and would be styled a &ldquo;subjective hallucination&rdquo;.&nbsp;
The second contributed knowledge of facts not previously known to the
witness, and so the vulgar would call it a ghost.&nbsp; Both appearances
were very rich and full of complicated detail.&nbsp; Indeed, any ghost
that wears clothes is a puzzle.&nbsp; Nobody but savages thinks that
clothes have ghosts, but Tom Sawyer conjectures that ghosts&rsquo; clothes
&ldquo;are made of ghost stuff&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As a rule, not very much is seen of a ghost; he is &ldquo;something
of a shadowy being&rdquo;.&nbsp; Yet we very seldom hear of a ghost
stark naked; that of Sergeant Davies, murdered in 1749, is one of three
or four examples in civilised life. <a name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b">{69b}</a>&nbsp;
Hence arises the old question, &ldquo;How are we to account for the
clothes of ghosts?&rdquo; One obvious reply is that there is no ghost
at all, only a hallucination.&nbsp; We do not see people naked, as a
rule, in our dreams; and hallucinations, being waking dreams, conform
to the same rule.&nbsp; If a ghost opens a door or lifts a curtain in
our sight, that, too, is only part of the illusion.&nbsp; The door did
not open; the curtain was not lifted.&nbsp; Nay, if the wrist or hand
of the seer is burned or withered, as in a crowd of stories, the ghost&rsquo;s
hand did not produce the effect.&nbsp; It was produced in the same way
as when a hypnotised patient is told that &ldquo;his hand is burned,&rdquo;
his fancy then begets real blisters, or so we are informed, truly or
not.&nbsp; The stigmata of St. Francis and others are explained in the
same way. <a name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70">{70}</a>&nbsp;
How ghosts pull bedclothes off and make objects fly about is another
question: in any case the ghosts are not <i>seen</i> in the act.</p>
<p>Thus the clothes of ghosts, their properties, and their actions affecting
physical objects, are not more difficult to explain than a naked ghost
would be, they are all the &ldquo;stuff that dreams are made of&rdquo;.&nbsp;
But occasionally things are carried to a great pitch, as when a ghost
drives off in a ghostly dogcart, with a ghostly horse, whip and harness.&nbsp;
Of this complicated kind we give two examples; the first reckons as
a &ldquo;subjective,&rdquo; the second as a veracious hallucination.</p>
<h3>THE OLD FAMILY COACH</h3>
<p>A distinguished and accomplished country gentleman and politician,
of scientific tastes, was riding in the New Forest, some twelve miles
from the place where he was residing.&nbsp; In a grassy glade he discovered
that he did not very clearly know his way to a country town which he
intended to visit.&nbsp; At this moment, on the other side of some bushes
a carriage drove along, and then came into clear view where there was
a gap in the bushes.&nbsp; Mr. Hyndford saw it perfectly distinctly;
it was a slightly antiquated family carriage, the sides were in that
imitation of wicker work on green panel which was once so common.&nbsp;
The coachman was a respectable family servant, he drove two horses:
two old ladies were in the carriage, one of them wore a hat, the other
a bonnet.&nbsp; They passed, and then Mr. Hyndford, going through the
gap in the bushes, rode after them to ask his way.&nbsp; There was no
carriage in sight, the avenue ended in a <i>cul-de-sac</i> of tangled
brake, and there were no traces of wheels on the grass.&nbsp; Mr. Hyndford
rode back to his original point of view, and looked for any object which
could suggest the illusion of one old-fashioned carriage, one coachman,
two horses and two elderly ladies, one in a hat and one in a bonnet.&nbsp;
He looked in vain&mdash;and that is all!</p>
<p>Nobody in his senses would call this appearance a ghostly one.&nbsp;
The name, however, would be applied to the following tale of</p>
<h3>RIDING HOME FROM MESS</h3>
<p>In 1854, General Barter, C.B., was a subaltern in the 75th Regiment,
and was doing duty at the hill station of Murree in the Punjaub.&nbsp;
He lived in a house built recently by a Lieutenant B., who died, as
researches at the War Office prove, at Peshawur on 2nd January, 1854.&nbsp;
The house was on a spur of the hill, three or four hundred yards under
the only road, with which it communicated by a &ldquo;bridle path,&rdquo;
never used by horsemen.&nbsp; That path ended in a precipice; a footpath
led into the bridle path from Mr. Barter&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>One evening Mr. Barter had a visit from a Mr. and Mrs. Deane, who
stayed till near eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There was a full moon,
and Mr. Barter walked to the bridle path with his friends, who climbed
it to join the road.&nbsp; He loitered with two dogs, smoking a cigar,
and just as he turned to go home, he heard a horse&rsquo;s hoofs coming
down the bridle path.&nbsp; At a bend of the path a tall hat came into
view, then round the corner, the wearer of the hat, who rode a pony
and was attended by two native grooms.&nbsp; &ldquo;At this time the
two dogs came, and crouching at my side, gave low frightened whimpers.&nbsp;
The moon was at the full, a tropical moon, so bright that you could
see to read a newspaper by its light, and I saw the party above me advance
as plainly as if it were noon-day; they were above me some eight or
ten feet on the bridle road. . . .&nbsp; On the party came, . . . and
now I had better describe them.&nbsp; The rider was in full dinner dress,
with white waistcoat and a tall chimney-pot hat, and he sat on a powerful
hill pony (dark-brown, with black mane and tail) in a listless sort
of way, the reins hanging loosely from both hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Grooms
led the pony and supported the rider.&nbsp; Mr. Barter, knowing that
there was no place they could go to but his own house, cried &ldquo;<i>Quon
hai</i>?&rdquo; (who is it?), adding in English, &ldquo;Hullo, what
the devil do you want here?&rdquo;&nbsp; The group halted, the rider
gathered up the reins with both hands, and turning, showed Mr. Barter
the known features of the late Lieutenant B.</p>
<p>He was very pale, the face was a dead man&rsquo;s face, he was stouter
than when Mr. Barter knew him and he wore <i>a dark Newgate fringe.</i></p>
<p>Mr. Barter dashed up the bank, the earth thrown up in making the
bridle path crumbled under him, he fell, scrambled on, reached the bridle
path where the group had stopped, and found nobody.&nbsp; Mr. Barter
ran up the path for a hundred yards, as nobody could go <i>down</i>
it except over a precipice, and neither heard nor saw anything.&nbsp;
His dogs did not accompany him.</p>
<p>Next day Mr. Barter gently led his friend Deane to talk of Lieutenant
B., who said that the lieutenant &ldquo;grew very bloated before his
death, and while on the sick list he allowed the fringe to grow in spite
of all we could say to him, and I believe he was buried with it&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Mr. Barter then asked where he got the pony, describing it minutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bought him at Peshawur, and killed him one day, riding
in his reckless fashion down the hill to Trete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Barter and his wife often heard the horse&rsquo;s hoofs later,
though he doubts if any one but B. had ever ridden the bridle path.&nbsp;
His Hindoo bearer he found one day armed with a <i>lattie</i>, being
determined to waylay the sound, which &ldquo;passed him like a typhoon&rdquo;.
<a name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74">{74}</a>&nbsp; Here the
appearance gave correct information unknown previously to General Barter,
namely, that Lieutenant B. grew stout and wore a beard before his death,
also that he had owned a brown pony, with black mane and tail.&nbsp;
Even granting that the ghosts of the pony and lieutenant were present
(both being dead), we are not informed that the grooms were dead also.&nbsp;
The hallucination, on the theory of &ldquo;mental telegraphy,&rdquo;
was telegraphed to General Barter&rsquo;s mind from some one who had
seen Lieutenant B. ride home from mess not very sober, or from the mind
of the defunct lieutenant, or, perhaps, from that of the deceased pony.&nbsp;
The message also reached and alarmed General Barter&rsquo;s dogs.</p>
<p>Something of the same kind may or may not explain Mr. Hyndford&rsquo;s
view of the family coach, which gave no traceable information.</p>
<p>The following story, in which an appearance of the dead conveyed
information not known to the seer, and so deserving to be called veracious,
is a little ghastly.</p>
<h3>THE BRIGHT SCAR</h3>
<p>In 1867, Miss G., aged eighteen, died suddenly of cholera in St.
Louis.&nbsp; In 1876 a brother, F. G., who was much attached to her,
had done a good day&rsquo;s business in St. Joseph.&nbsp; He was sending
in his orders to his employers (he is a commercial traveller) and was
smoking a cigar, when he became conscious that some one was sitting
on his left, with one arm on the table.&nbsp; It was his dead sister.&nbsp;
He sprang up to embrace her (for even on meeting a stranger whom we
take for a dead friend, we never realise the impossibility in the half
moment of surprise) but she was gone.&nbsp; Mr. G. stood there, the
ink wet on his pen, the cigar lighted in his hand, the name of his sister
on his lips.&nbsp; He had noted her expression, features, dress, the
kindness of her eyes, the glow of the complexion, and what he had never
seen before, <i>a bright red scratch on the right side of her face.</i></p>
<p>Mr. G. took the next train home to St. Louis, and told the story
to his parents.&nbsp; His father was inclined to ridicule him, but his
mother nearly fainted.&nbsp; When she could control herself, she said
that, unknown to any one, she had accidentally scratched the face of
the dead, apparently with the pin of her brooch, while arranging something
about the corpse.&nbsp; She had obliterated the scratch with powder,
and had kept the fact to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told me she <i>knew</i>
at least that I had seen my sister.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few weeks later Mrs.
G. died. <a name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75">{75}</a></p>
<p>Here the information existed in one living mind, the mother&rsquo;s,
and if there is any &ldquo;mental telegraphy,&rdquo; may thence have
been conveyed to Mr. F. G.</p>
<p>Another kind of cases which may be called veracious, occurs when
the ghost seer, after seeing the ghost, recognises it in a portrait
not previously beheld.&nbsp; Of course, allowance must be made for fancy,
and for conscious or unconscious hoaxing.&nbsp; You see a spook in Castle
Dangerous.&nbsp; You then recognise the portrait in the hall, or elsewhere.&nbsp;
The temptation to recognise the spook rather more clearly than you really
do, is considerable, just as one is tempted to recognise the features
of the Stuarts in the royal family, of the parents in a baby, or in
any similar case.</p>
<p>Nothing is more common in literary ghost stories than for somebody
to see a spectre and afterwards recognise him or her in a portrait not
before seen.&nbsp; There is an early example in Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s
<i>Tapestried Chamber</i>, which was told to him by Miss Anna Seward.&nbsp;
Another such tale is by Th&eacute;ophile Gautier.&nbsp; In an essay
on Illusions by Mr. James Sully, a case is given.&nbsp; A lady (who
corroborated the story to the present author) was vexed all night by
a spectre in armour.&nbsp; Next morning she saw, what she had not previously
observed, a portrait of the spectre in the room.&nbsp; Mr. Sully explains
that she had seen the portrait <i>unconsciously</i>, and dreamed of
it.&nbsp; He adds the curious circumstance that other people have had
the same experience in the same room, which his explanation does not
cover.&nbsp; The following story is published by the Society for Psychical
Research, attested by the seer and her husband, whose real names are
known, but not published. <a name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76">{76}</a></p>
<h3>THE VISION AND THE PORTRAIT</h3>
<p>Mrs. M. writes (December 15, 1891) that before her vision she had
heard nothing about hauntings in the house occupied by herself and her
husband, and nothing about the family sorrows of her predecessors there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night, on retiring to my bedroom about 11 o&rsquo;clock,
I thought I heard a peculiar moaning sound, and some one sobbing as
if in great distress of mind.&nbsp; I listened very attentively, and
still it continued; so I raised the gas in my bedroom, and then went
to the window on the landing, drew the blind aside, and there on the
grass was a very beautiful young girl in a kneeling posture, before
a soldier in a general&rsquo;s uniform, sobbing and clasping her hands
together, entreating for pardon, but alas! he only waved her away from
him.&nbsp; So much did I feel for the girl that I ran down the staircase
to the door opening upon the lawn, and begged her to come in and tell
me her sorrow.&nbsp; The figures then disappeared gradually, as in a
dissolving view.&nbsp; Not in the least nervous did I feel then; went
again to my bedroom, took a sheet of writing-paper, and wrote down what
I had seen.&rdquo; <a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77">{77}</a></p>
<p>Mrs. M., whose husband was absent, began to feel nervous, and went
to another lady&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>She later heard of an old disgrace to the youngest daughter of the
proud family, her predecessors in the house.&nbsp; The poor girl tried
in vain to win forgiveness, especially from a near relative, a soldier,
Sir X. Y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So vivid was my remembrance of the features of the soldier,
that some months after the occurrence [of the vision] when I called
with my husband at a house where there was a portrait of him, I stepped
before it and said, &lsquo;Why, look! there is the General!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And sure enough it <i>was</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. M. had not heard that the portrait was in the room where she
saw it.&nbsp; Mr. M. writes that he took her to the house where he knew
it to be without telling her of its existence.&nbsp; Mrs. M. turned
pale when she saw it.&nbsp; Mr. M. knew the sad old story, but had kept
it to himself.&nbsp; The family in which the disgrace occurred, in 1847
or 1848, were his relations. <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78">{78}</a></p>
<p>This vision was a veracious hallucination; it gave intelligence not
otherwise known to Mrs. M., and capable of confirmation, therefore the
appearances would be called &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo;.&nbsp; The majority
of people do not believe in the truth of any such stories of veracious
hallucinations, just as they do not believe in veracious dreams.&nbsp;
Mr. Galton, out of all his packets of reports of hallucinations, does
not even allude to a veracious example, whether he has records of such
a thing or not.&nbsp; Such reports, however, are ghost stories, &ldquo;which
we now proceed,&rdquo; or continue, &ldquo;to narrate&rdquo;.&nbsp;
The reader will do well to remember that while everything ghostly, and
not to be explained by known physical facts, is in the view of science
a hallucination, every hallucination is not a ghost for the purposes
of story-telling.&nbsp; The hallucination must, for story-telling purposes,
be <i>veracious</i>.</p>
<p>Following our usual method, we naturally begin with the anecdotes
least trying to the judicial faculties, and most capable of an ordinary
explanation.&nbsp; Perhaps of all the senses, the sense of touch, though
in some ways the surest, is in others the most easily deceived.&nbsp;
Some people who cannot call up a clear mental image of things seen,
say a saltcellar, can readily call up a mental revival of the feeling
of touching salt.&nbsp; Again, a slight accidental throb, or leap of
a sinew or vein, may feel so like a touch that we turn round to see
who touched us.&nbsp; These familiar facts go far to make the following
tale more or less conceivable.</p>
<h3>THE RESTRAINING HAND</h3>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty years ago,&rdquo; writes Mrs. Elliot, &ldquo;I
received some letters by post, one of which contained &pound;15 in bank
notes.&nbsp; After reading the letters I went into the kitchen with
them in my hands.&nbsp; I was alone at the time. . . .&nbsp; Having
done with the letters, I made an effort to throw them into the fire,
when I distinctly felt my hand arrested in the act.&nbsp; It was as
though another hand were gently laid upon my own, pressing it back.&nbsp;
Much surprised, I looked at my hand and then saw it contained, not the
letters I had intended to destroy, but the bank notes, and that the
letters were in the other hand.&nbsp; I was so surprised that I called
out, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s here?&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a">{80a}</a></p>
<p>Nobody will call this &ldquo;the touch of a vanished hand&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Part of Mrs. Elliot&rsquo;s mind knew what she was about, and started
an unreal but veracious feeling to warn her.&nbsp; We shall come to
plenty of Hands not so readily disposed of.</p>
<p>Next to touch, the sense most apt to be deceived is hearing.&nbsp;
Every one who has listened anxiously for an approaching carriage, has
often heard it come before it came.&nbsp; In the summer of 1896 the
writer, with a lady and another companion, were standing on the veranda
at the back of a house in Dumfriesshire, waiting for a cab to take one
of them to the station.&nbsp; They heard a cab arrive and draw up, went
round to the front of the house, saw the servant open the door and bring
out the luggage, but wheeled vehicle there was none in sound or sight.&nbsp;
Yet all four persons had heard it, probably by dint of expectation.</p>
<p>To hear articulate voices where there are none is extremely common
in madness, <a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b">{80b}</a>
but not very rare, as Mr. Galton shows, among the sane.&nbsp; When the
voices are veracious, give unknown information, they are in the same
case as truthful dreams.&nbsp; I offer a few from the experience, reported
to me by himself, of a man of learning whom I shall call a Benedictine
monk, though that is not his real position in life.</p>
<h3>THE BENEDICTINE&rsquo;S VOICES</h3>
<p>My friend, as a lad, was in a strait between the choice of two professions.&nbsp;
He prayed for enlightenment, and soon afterwards heard an <i>internal</i>
voice, advising a certain course.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you act on it?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I considered that in my circumstances
it did not demand attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, when a man grown, he was in his study merely idling over some
books on the table, when he heard a loud voice from a corner of the
room assert that a public event of great importance would occur at a
given date.&nbsp; It did occur.&nbsp; About the same time, being abroad,
he was in great anxiety as to a matter involving only himself.&nbsp;
Of this he never spoke to any one.&nbsp; On his return to England his
mother said, &ldquo;You were very wretched about so and so&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard ---&rsquo;s voice telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now --- had died years before, in childhood.</p>
<p>In these cases the Benedictine&rsquo;s own conjecture and his mother&rsquo;s
affection probably divined facts, which did not present themselves as
thoughts in the ordinary way, but took the form of unreal voices.</p>
<p>There are many examples, as of the girl in her bath who heard a voice
say &ldquo;Open the door&rdquo; four times, did so, then fainted, and
only escaped drowning by ringing the bell just before she swooned.</p>
<p>Of course she might not have swooned if she had not been alarmed
by hearing the voices.&nbsp; These tales are dull enough, and many voices,
like Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s, when he heard her call his
name, she being hundreds of miles away, lead to nothing and are not
veracious.&nbsp; When they are veracious, as in the case of dreams,
it may be by sheer accident.</p>
<p>In a similar class are &ldquo;warnings&rdquo; conveyed by the eye,
not by the ear.&nbsp; The Maoris of New Zealand believe that if one
sees a body lying across a path or oneself on the opposite side of a
river, it is wiser to try another path and a different ford.</p>
<h3>THE MAN AT THE LIFT</h3>
<p>In the same way, in August, 1890, a lady in a Boston hotel in the
dusk rang for the lift, walked along the corridor and looked out of
a window, started to run to the door of the lift, saw a man in front
of it, stopped, and when the lighted lift came up, found that the door
was wide open and that, had she run on as she intended, she would have
fallen down the well.&nbsp; Here part of her mind may have known that
the door was open, and started a ghost (for there was no real man there)
to stop her.&nbsp; Pity that these things do not occur more frequently.&nbsp;
They do&mdash;in New Zealand. <a name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82">{82}</a></p>
<p>These are a few examples of useful veracious waking dreams.&nbsp;
The sort of which we hear most are &ldquo;wraiths&rdquo;.&nbsp; A, when
awake, meets B, who is dead or dying or quite well at a distance.&nbsp;
The number of these stories is legion.&nbsp; To these we advance, under
their Highland title, <i>spirits of the living.</i></p>

Transition to Appearances of the Dead.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirits of the living&rdquo; is the Highland term for the
appearances of people who are alive and well&mdash;but elsewhere.&nbsp;
The common Highland belief is that they show themselves to second-sighted
persons, very frequently before the arrival of a stranger or a visitor,
expected or unexpected.&nbsp; Probably many readers have had the experience
of meeting an acquaintance in the street.&nbsp; He passes us, and within
a hundred yards we again meet and talk with our friend.&nbsp; When he
is of very marked appearance, or has any strong peculiarity, the experience
is rather perplexing.&nbsp; Perhaps a few bits of hallucination are
sprinkled over a real object.&nbsp; This ordinary event leads on to
what are called &ldquo;Arrivals,&rdquo; that is when a person is seen,
heard and perhaps spoken to in a place to which he is travelling, but
whither he has not yet arrived.&nbsp; Mark Twain gives an instance in
his own experience.&nbsp; At a large crowded reception he saw approaching
him in the throng a lady whom he had known and liked many years before.&nbsp;
When she was near him, he lost sight of her, but met her at supper,
dressed as he had seen her in the &ldquo;levee&rdquo;.&nbsp; At that
moment she was travelling by railway to the town in which he was. <a name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a">{85a}</a></p>
<p>A large number of these cases have been printed. <a name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b">{85b}</a>&nbsp;
In one case a gentleman and lady from their window saw his brother and
sister-in-law drive past, with a horse which they knew had not been
out for some weeks.&nbsp; The seers were presently joined by the visitors&rsquo;
daughter, who had met the party on the road, she having just left them
at their house.&nbsp; Ten minutes later the real pair arrived, horse
and all. <a name="citation85c"></a><a href="#footnote85c">{85c}</a></p>
<p>This last affair is one of several tales of &ldquo;Phantom Coaches,&rdquo;
not only heard but seen, the coach being a coach of the living.&nbsp;
In 1893 the author was staying at a Highland castle, when one of the
ladies observed to her nephew, &ldquo;So you and Susan <i>did</i> drive
in the dogcart; I saw you pass my window&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, we
didn&rsquo;t; but we spoke of doing it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady then mentioned
minute details of the dress and attitudes of her relations as they passed
her window, where the drive turned from the hall door through the park;
but, in fact, no such journey had been made.&nbsp; Dr. Hack Tuke published
the story of the &ldquo;Arrival&rdquo; of Dr. Boase at his house a quarter
of an hour before he came, the people who saw him supposing him to be
in Paris. <a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86">{86}</a></p>
<p>When a person is seen in &ldquo;Arrival&rdquo; cases before he arrives,
the affair is not so odd if he is expected.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, expectation
does sometimes conjure up phantasms, and the author once saw (as he
supposed) a serious accident occur which in fact did not take place,
though it seemed unavoidable.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, this creation of phantasms by expectant attention
seems to be rare where &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; are expected.&nbsp; The
author has slept in several haunted houses, but has never seen what
he was led to expect.&nbsp; In many instances, as in &ldquo;The Lady
in Black&rdquo; (<i>infra</i>), a ghost who is a frequent visitor is
never seen when people watch for her.&nbsp; Among the many persons who
have had delusions as to the presence of the dead, very few have been
hoping, praying for and expecting them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I look for ghosts, but none will force<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their way to me: &rsquo;Tis falsely said<br />
That there was ever intercourse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the living and the dead,<br />
For surely then I should have sight<br />
Of him I wait for day and night<br />
With love and longings infinite.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Affliction of Margaret has been the affliction of most of us.&nbsp;
There are curious historical examples of these appearances of the living.&nbsp;
Goethe declares that he once met himself at a certain place in a certain
dress, and several years later found himself there in that costume.&nbsp;
Shelley was seen by his friends at Lerici to pass along a balcony whence
there was no exit.&nbsp; However, he could not be found there.&nbsp;
The story of the wraith of Catherine the Great is variously narrated.&nbsp;
We give it as told by an eye-witness, the Comte de Ribaupierre, about
1862 to Lady Napier and Ettrick.&nbsp; The Count, in 1862, was a very
old man, and more than thirty years have passed since he gave the tale
to Lady Napier, whose memory retains it in the following form:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE WRAITH OF THE CZARINA</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the exercise of his duties as one of the pages-in-waiting,
Ribaupierre followed one day his august mistress into the throne-room
of the palace.&nbsp; When the Empress, accompanied by the high officers
of her court and the ladies of her household, came in sight of the chair
of state which she was about to occupy, she suddenly stopped, and to
the horror and astonished awe of her courtiers, she pointed to a visionary
being seated on the imperial throne.&nbsp; The occupant of the chair
was an exact counterpart of herself.&nbsp; All saw it and trembled,
but none dared to move towards the mysterious presentment of their sovereign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a moment of dead silence the great Catherine raised
her voice and ordered her guard to advance and fire on the apparition.&nbsp;
The order was obeyed, a mirror beside the throne was shattered, the
vision had disappeared, and the Empress, with no sign of emotion, took
the chair from which her semblance had passed away.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is a striking barbaric scene!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirits of the living&rdquo; of this kind are common enough.&nbsp;
In the Highlands &ldquo;second sight&rdquo; generally means a view of
an event or accident some time before its occurrence.&nbsp; Thus an
old man was sitting with a little boy on a felled tree beside a steep
track in a quarry at Ballachulish.&nbsp; Suddenly he jerked the boy
to one side, and threw himself down on the further side of the tree.&nbsp;
While the boy stared, the old man slowly rose, saying, &ldquo;The spirits
of the living are strong to-day!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had seen a mass of
rock dashing along, killing some quarrymen and tearing down the path.&nbsp;
The accident occurred next day.&nbsp; It is needless to dwell on second
sight, which is not peculiar to Celts, though the Highlanders talk more
about it than other people.</p>
<p>These appearances of the living but absent, whether caused by some
mental action of the person who appears or not, are, at least, <i>unconscious</i>
on his part. <a name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88">{88}</a>&nbsp;
But a few cases occur in which a living person is said, by a voluntary
exertion of mind, to have made himself visible to a friend at a distance.&nbsp;
One case is vouched for by Baron von Schrenck-Notzig, a German psychologist,
who himself made the experiment with success.&nbsp; Others are narrated
by Dr. Gibotteau.&nbsp; A curious tale is told by several persons as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<h3>AN &ldquo;ASTRAL BODY&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Mr. Sparks and Mr. Cleave, young men of twenty and nineteen, were
accustomed to &ldquo;mesmerise&rdquo; each other in their dormitory
at Portsmouth, where they were students of naval engineering.&nbsp;
Mr. Sparks simply stared into Mr. Cleave&rsquo;s eyes as he lay on his
bed till he &ldquo;went off&rdquo;.&nbsp; The experiments seemed so
curious that witnesses were called, Mr. Darley and Mr. Thurgood.&nbsp;
On Friday, 15th January, 1886, Mr. Cleave determined to try to see,
when asleep, a young lady at Wandsworth to whom he was in the habit
of writing every Sunday.&nbsp; He also intended, if possible, to make
<i>her</i> see <i>him</i>.&nbsp; On awaking, he said that he had seen
her in the dining-room of her house, that she had seemed to grow restless,
had looked at him, and then had covered her face with her hands.&nbsp;
On Monday he tried again, and he thought he had frightened her, as after
looking at him for a few minutes she fell back in her chair in a kind
of faint.&nbsp; Her little brother was in the room with her at the time.&nbsp;
On Tuesday next the young lady wrote, telling Mr. Cleave that she had
been startled by seeing him on Friday evening (this is an error), and
again on Monday evening, &ldquo;much clearer,&rdquo; when she nearly
fainted.</p>
<p>All this Mr. Sparks wrote to Mr. Gurney in the same week.&nbsp; He
was inviting instructions on hypnotic experiments, and &ldquo;launched
a letter into space,&rdquo; having read something vague about Mr. Gurney&rsquo;s
studies in the newspapers.&nbsp; The letter, after some adventures,
arrived, and on 15th March Mr. Cleave wrote his account, Mr. Darley
and Mr. Thurgood corroborating as to their presence during the trance
and as to Mr. Cleave&rsquo;s statement when he awoke.&nbsp; Mr. Cleave
added that he made experiments &ldquo;for five nights running&rdquo;
before seeing the lady.&nbsp; The young lady&rsquo;s letter of 19th
January, 1886, is also produced (postmark, Portsmouth, 20th January).&nbsp;
But the lady mentions her <i>first</i> vision of Mr. Cleave as on last
<i>Tuesday</i> (not Friday), and her second, while she was alone with
her little brother, at supper on Monday.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was so frightened
that I nearly fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are all young people.&nbsp; It may be said that all five were
concerned in a complicated hoax on Mr. Gurney.&nbsp; Nor would such
a hoax argue any unusual moral obliquity.&nbsp; Surtees of Mainsforth,
in other respects an honourable man, took in Sir Walter Scott with forged
ballads, and never undeceived his friend.&nbsp; Southey played off a
hoax with his book <i>The Doctor</i>.&nbsp; Hogg, Lockhart, and Wilson,
with Allan Cunningham and many others, were constantly engaged in such
mystifications, and a &ldquo;ghost-hunter&rdquo; might seem a fair butt.</p>
<p>But the very discrepancy in Miss ---&rsquo;s letter is a proof of
fairness.&nbsp; Her first vision of Mr. Cleave was on &ldquo;Tuesday
last&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mr. Cleave&rsquo;s first impression of success was
on the Friday following.</p>
<p>But he had been making the experiment for five nights previous, including
the Tuesday of Miss ---&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; Had the affair been a
hoax, Miss --- would either have been requested by him to re-write her
letter, putting Friday for Tuesday, or what is simpler, Mr. Sparks would
have adopted her version and written &ldquo;Tuesday&rdquo; in place
of &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; in his first letter to Mr. Gurney.&nbsp; The
young lady, naturally, requested Mr. Cleave not to try his experiment
on her again.</p>
<p>A similar case is that of Mrs. Russell, who tried successfully, when
awake and in Scotland, to appear to one of her family in Germany.&nbsp;
The sister corroborates and says, &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t come appearing
to me again&rdquo;. <a name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a">{91a}</a></p>
<p>These spirits of the living lead to the subject of spirits of the
dying.&nbsp; No kind of tale is so common as that of dying people appearing
at a distance.&nbsp; Hundreds have been conscientiously published. <a name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b">{91b}</a>&nbsp;
The belief is prevalent among the Maoris of New Zealand, where the apparition
is regarded as a proof of death. <a name="citation91c"></a><a href="#footnote91c">{91c}</a>&nbsp;
Now there is nothing in savage philosophy to account for this opinion
of the Maoris.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; leaves his body
in dreams, savages think, and as dreaming is infinitely more common
than death, the Maoris should argue that the appearance is that of a
man&rsquo;s spirit wandering in his sleep.&nbsp; However, they, like
many Europeans, associate a man&rsquo;s apparition with his death.&nbsp;
Not being derived from their philosophy, this habit may be deduced from
their experience.</p>
<p>As there are, undeniably, many examples of hallucinatory appearances
of persons in perfect health and ordinary circumstances, the question
has been asked whether there are <i>more</i> cases of an apparition
coinciding with death than, according to the doctrine of chances, there
ought to be.&nbsp; Out of about 18,000 answers to questions on this
subject, has been deduced the conclusion that the deaths do coincide
with the apparitions to an extent beyond mere accident.&nbsp; Even if
we had an empty hallucination for every case coinciding with death,
we could not set the coincidences down to mere chance.&nbsp; As well
might we say that if &ldquo;at the end of an hour&rsquo;s rifle practice
at long-distance range, the record shows that for every shot that has
hit the bull&rsquo;s eye, another has missed the target, therefore the
shots that hit the target did so by accident.&rdquo; <a name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92">{92}</a>&nbsp;
But as empty hallucinations are more likely to be forgotten than those
which coincide with a death; as exaggeration creeps in, as the collectors
of evidence are naturally inclined to select and question people whom
they know to have a good story to tell, the evidence connecting apparitions,
voices, and so on with deaths is not likely to be received with favour.</p>
<p>One thing must be remembered as affecting the theory that the coincidence
between the wraith and the death is purely an accident.&nbsp; Everybody
dreams and out of the innumerable dreams of mankind, a few must hit
the mark by a fluke.&nbsp; But <i>hallucinations</i> are not nearly
so common as dreams.&nbsp; Perhaps, roughly speaking, one person in
ten has had what he believes to be a waking hallucination.&nbsp; Therefore,
so to speak, compared with dreams, but a small number of shots of this
kind are fired.&nbsp; Therefore, bull&rsquo;s eyes (the coincidence
between an appearance and a death) are infinitely less likely to be
due to chance in the case of waking hallucinations than in the case
of dreams, which all mankind are firing off every night of their lives.&nbsp;
Stories of these coincidences between appearances and deaths are as
common as they are dull.&nbsp; Most people come across them in the circle
of their friends.&nbsp; They are all very much alike, and make tedious
reading.&nbsp; We give a few which have some picturesque features.</p>
<h3>IN TAVISTOCK PLACE <a name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93">{93}</a></h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the latter part of the autumn of 1878, between half-past
three and four in the morning, I was leisurely walking home from the
house of a sick friend.&nbsp; A middle-aged woman, apparently a nurse,
was slowly following, going in the same direction.&nbsp; We crossed
Tavistock Square together, and emerged simultaneously into Tavistock
Place.&nbsp; The streets and squares were deserted, the morning bright
and calm, my health excellent, nor did I suffer from anxiety or fatigue.&nbsp;
A man suddenly appeared, striding up Tavistock Place, coming towards
me, and going in a direction opposite to mine.&nbsp; When first seen
he was standing exactly in front of my own door (5 Tavistock Place).&nbsp;
Young and ghastly pale, he was dressed in evening clothes, evidently
made by a foreign tailor.&nbsp; Tall and slim, he walked with long measured
strides noiselessly.&nbsp; A tall white hat, covered thickly with black
crape, and an eyeglass, completed the costume of this strange form.&nbsp;
The moonbeams falling on the corpse-like features revealed a face well
known to me, that of a friend and relative.&nbsp; The sole and only
person in the street beyond myself and this being was the woman already
alluded to.&nbsp; She stopped abruptly, as if spell-bound, then rushing
towards the man, she gazed intently and with horror unmistakable on
his face, which was now upturned to the heavens and smiling ghastly.&nbsp;
She indulged in her strange contemplation but during very few seconds,
then with extraordinary and unexpected speed for her weight and age
she ran away with a terrific shriek and yell.&nbsp; This woman never
have I seen or heard of since, and but for her presence I could have
explained the incident: called it, say, subjection of the mental powers
to the domination of physical reflex action, and the man&rsquo;s presence
could have been termed a false impression on the retina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week after this event, news of this very friend&rsquo;s
death reached me.&nbsp; It occurred on the morning in question.&nbsp;
From the family I learned that according to the rites of the Greek Church
and the custom of the country he resided in, he was buried in his evening
clothes made abroad by a foreign tailor, and strange to say, he wore
goloshes over his boots, according also to the custom of the country
he died in. . . .&nbsp; When in England, he lived in Tavistock Place,
and occupied my rooms during my absence.&rdquo; <a name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a">{95a}</a></p>
<h3>THE WYNYARD WRAITH <a name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b">{95b}</a></h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the month of November (1785 or 1786), Sir John Sherbrooke
and Colonel Wynyard were sitting before dinner in their barrack room
at Sydney Cove, in America.&nbsp; It was duskish, and a candle was placed
on a table at a little distance.&nbsp; A figure dressed in plain clothes
and a good round hat, passed gently between the above people and the
fire.&nbsp; While passing, Sir J. Sherbrooke exclaimed, &lsquo;God bless
my soul, who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost at the same moment Colonel W. said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
my brother John Wynyard, and I am sure he is dead&rsquo;.&nbsp; Colonel
W. was much agitated, and cried and sobbed a great deal.&nbsp; Sir John
said, &lsquo;The fellow has a devilish good hat; I wish I had it&rsquo;.&nbsp;
(Hats were not to be got there and theirs were worn out.)&nbsp; They
immediately got up (Sir John was on crutches, having broken his leg),
took a candle and went into the bedroom, into which the figure had entered.&nbsp;
They searched the bed and every corner of the room to no effect; the
windows were fastened up with mortar. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;They received no communication from England for about five
months, when a letter from Mr. Rush, the surgeon (Coldstream Guards),
announced the death of John Wynyard at the moment, as near as could
be ascertained, when the figure appeared.&nbsp; In addition to this
extraordinary circumstance, Sir John told me that two years and a half
afterwards he was walking with Lilly Wynyard (a brother of Colonel W.)
in London, and seeing somebody on the other side of the way, he recognised,
he thought, the person who had appeared to him and Colonel Wynyard in
America.&nbsp; Lilly Wynyard said that the person pointed out was a
Mr. Eyre (Hay?), that he and John Wynyard were frequently mistaken for
each other, and that money had actually been paid to this Mr. Eyre in
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A famous tale of an appearance is Lord Brougham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His
Lordship was not reckoned precisely a veracious man; on the other hand,
this was not the kind of fable he was likely to tell.&nbsp; He was brought
up under the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of common-sense.&nbsp; &ldquo;On all
such subjects my father was very sceptical,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; To
disbelieve Lord Brougham we must suppose either that he wilfully made
a false entry in his diary in 1799, or that in preparing his <i>Autobiography</i>
in 1862, he deliberately added a falsehood&mdash;and then explained
his own marvel away!</p>
<h3>LORD BROUGHAM&rsquo;S STORY</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<i>December</i> 19, 1799.</p>
<p>&ldquo; . . . At one in the morning, arriving at a decent inn (in
Sweden), we decided to stop for the night, and found a couple of comfortable
rooms.&nbsp; Tired with the cold of yesterday, I was glad to take advantage
of a hot bath before I turned in.&nbsp; And here a most remarkable thing
happened to me&mdash;so remarkable that I must tell the story from the
beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I left the High School, I went with G---, my most intimate
friend, to attend the classes in the University. . . .&nbsp; We actually
committed the folly of drawing up an agreement, written with our blood,
to the effect that whichever of us died the first should appear to the
other, and thus solve any doubts we had entertained of &lsquo;the life
after death&rsquo;.&nbsp; G--- went to India, years passed, and,&rdquo;
says Lord Brougham, &ldquo;I had nearly forgotten his existence.&nbsp;
I had taken, as I have said, a warm bath, and while lying in it and
enjoying the comfort of the heat, I turned my head round, looking towards
the chair on which I had deposited my clothes, as I was about to get
out of the bath.&nbsp; On the chair sat G---, looking calmly at me.&nbsp;
How I got out of the bath I know not, but on recovering my senses I
found myself sprawling on the floor.&nbsp; The apparition, or whatever
it was that had taken the likeness of G---, had disappeared. . . .&nbsp;
So strongly was I affected by it that I have here written down the whole
history, with the date, 19th December, and all the particulars as they
are now fresh before me.&nbsp; No doubt I had fallen asleep&rdquo; (he
has just said that he was awake and on the point of leaving the bath),
&ldquo;and that the appearance presented so distinctly to my eyes was
a dream I cannot for a moment doubt. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 16th October, 1862, Lord Brougham copied this extract for his
<i>Autobiography</i>, and says that on his arrival in Edinburgh he received
a letter from India, announcing that G--- had died on 19th December.&nbsp;
He remarks &ldquo;singular coincidence!&rdquo; and adds that, considering
the vast number of dreams, the number of coincidences is perhaps fewer
than a fair calculation of chances would warrant us to expect.</p>
<p>This is a concession to common-sense, and argues an ignorance of
the fact that sane and (apparently) waking men may have hallucinations.&nbsp;
On the theory that we <i>may</i> have inappreciable moments of sleep
when we think ourselves awake, it is not an ordinary but an extraordinary
coincidence that Brougham should have had that peculiar moment of the
&ldquo;dream&rdquo; of G--- on the day or night of G---&rsquo;s death,
while the circumstance that he had made a compact with G--- multiplies
the odds against accident in a ratio which mathematicians may calculate.&nbsp;
Brougham was used to dreams, like other people; he was not shocked by
them.&nbsp; This &ldquo;dream&rdquo; &ldquo;produced such a shock that
I had no inclination to talk about it&rdquo;.&nbsp; Even on Brougham&rsquo;s
showing, then, this dream was a thing unique in his experience, and
not one of the swarm of visions of sleep.&nbsp; Thus his including it
among these, while his whole language shows that he himself did not
really reckon it among these, is an example of the fallacies of common-sense.&nbsp;
He completes his fallacy by saying, &ldquo;It is not much more wonderful
than that a person whom we had no reason to expect should appear to
us at the very moment we had been thinking or speaking of him&rdquo;.&nbsp;
But Lord Brougham had <i>not</i> been speaking or thinking of G---;
&ldquo;there had been nothing to call him to my recollection,&rdquo;
he says.&nbsp; To give his logic any value, he should constantly when
(as far as he knew) awake, have had dreams that &ldquo;shocked&rdquo;
him.&nbsp; Then <i>one</i> coincidence would have had no assignable
cause save ordinary accident.</p>
<p>If Lord Brougham fabled in 1799 or in 1862, he did so to make a &ldquo;sensation&rdquo;.&nbsp;
And then he tried to undo it by arguing that his experience was a thoroughly
commonplace affair.</p>
<p>We now give a very old story, &ldquo;The Dying Mother&rdquo;.&nbsp;
If the reader will compare it with Mr. Cleave&rsquo;s case, &ldquo;An
Astral Body,&rdquo; in this chapter, he will be struck by the resemblance.&nbsp;
Mr. Cleave and Mrs. Goffe were both in a trance.&nbsp; Both wished to
see persons at a distance.&nbsp; Both saw, and each was seen, Mrs. Goffe
by her children&rsquo;s nurse; Mr. Cleave by the person whom he wished
to see, but <i>not</i> by a small boy also present.</p>
<h3>THE DYING MOTHER <a name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101">{101}</a></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, the wife of John Goffe of Rochester, being afflicted
with a long illness, removed to her father&rsquo;s house at West Mulling,
about nine miles from her own.&nbsp; There she died on 4th June, this
present year, 1691.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day before her departure (death) she grew very impatiently
desirous to see her two children, whom she had left at home to the care
of a nurse.&nbsp; She prayed her husband to &lsquo;hire a horse, for
she must go home and die with the children&rsquo;.&nbsp; She was too
ill to be moved, but &lsquo;a minister who lives in the town was with
her at ten o&rsquo;clock that night, to whom she expressed good hopes
in the mercies of God and a willingness to die&rsquo;.&nbsp; &lsquo;But&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;it is my misery that I cannot see my children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between one and two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, she fell
into a trance.&nbsp; One, widow Turner, who watched with her that night,
says that her eyes were open and fixed and her jaw fallen.&nbsp; Mrs.
Turner put her hand upon her mouth and nostrils, but could perceive
no breath.&nbsp; She thought her to be in a fit; and doubted whether
she were dead or alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning the dying woman told her mother that she
had been at home with her children. . . . &lsquo;I was with them last
night when I was asleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nurse at Rochester, widow Alexander by name, affirms,
and says she will take her oath on&rsquo;t before a Magistrate and receive
the sacrament upon it, that a little before two o&rsquo;clock that morning
she saw the likeness of the said Mary Goffe come out of the next chamber
(where the elder child lay in a bed by itself) the door being left open,
and stood by her bedside for about a quarter of an hour; the younger
child was there lying by her.&nbsp; Her eyes moved and her mouth went,
but she said nothing.&nbsp; The nurse, moreover, says that she was perfectly
awake; it was then daylight, being one of the longest days in the year.&nbsp;
She sat up in bed and looked steadfastly on the apparition.&nbsp; In
that time she heard the bridge clock strike two, and a while after said,
&lsquo;In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, what art thou?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon the apparition removed and went away; she slipped on her clothes
and followed, but what became on&rsquo;t she cannot tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Alexander then walked out of doors till six, when she
persuaded some neighbours to let her in.&nbsp; She told her adventure;
they failed to persuade her that she had dreamed it.&nbsp; On the same
day the neighbour&rsquo;s wife, Mrs. Sweet, went to West Mulling, saw
Mrs. Goffe before her death, and heard from Mrs. Goffe&rsquo;s mother
the story of the daughter&rsquo;s dream of her children, Mrs. Sweet
not having mentioned the nurse&rsquo;s story of the apparition.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That poor Mrs. Goffe walked to Rochester and returned undetected, a
distance of eighteen miles is difficult to believe.</p>
<p>Goethe has an <i>obiter dictum</i> on the possibility of intercommunion
without the aid of the ordinary senses, between the souls of lovers.&nbsp;
Something of the kind is indicated in anecdotes of dreams dreamed in
common by husband and wife, but, in such cases, it may be urged that
the same circumstance, or the same noise or other disturbing cause,
may beget the same dream in both.&nbsp; A better instance is</p>
<h3>THE VISION OF THE BRIDE</h3>
<p>Colonel Meadows Taylor writes, in <i>The Story of my Life</i> (vol.
ii., p. 32): &ldquo;The determination (to live unmarried) was the result
of a very curious and strange incident that befel me during one of my
marches to Hyderabad.&nbsp; I have never forgotten it, and it returns
to this day to my memory with a strangely vivid effect that I can neither
repel nor explain.&nbsp; I purposely withhold the date of the year.&nbsp;
In my very early life I had been deeply and devotedly attached to one
in England, and only relinquished the hope of one day winning her when
the terrible order came out that no furlough to Europe would be granted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening I was at the village of Dewas Kudea, after a very
long afternoon and evening march from Muktul, and I lay down very weary;
but the barking of village dogs, the baying of jackals and over-fatigue
and heat prevented sleep, and I was wide awake and restless.&nbsp; Suddenly,
for my tent door was wide open, I saw the face and figure so familiar
to me, but looking older, and with a sad and troubled expression; the
dress was white and seemed covered with a profusion of lace and glistened
in the bright moonlight.&nbsp; The arms were stretched out, and a low
plaintive cry of &lsquo;Do not let me go!&nbsp; Do not let me go!&rsquo;
reached me.&nbsp; I sprang forward, but the figure receded, growing
fainter and fainter till I could see it no more, but the low plaintive
tones still sounded.&nbsp; I had run barefooted across the open space
where my tents were pitched, very much to the astonishment of the sentry
on guard, but I returned to my tent without speaking to him.&nbsp; I
wrote to my father.&nbsp; I wished to know whether there were any hope
for me.&nbsp; He wrote back to me these words: &lsquo;Too late, my dear
son&mdash;on the very day of the vision you describe to me, A. was married&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The colonel did not keep his determination not to marry, for his
<i>Life</i> is edited by his daughter, who often heard her father mention
the incident, &ldquo;precisely in the same manner, and exactly as it
is in the book&rdquo;. <a name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103">{103}</a></p>
<p>If thinking of friends and lovers, lost or dead, could bring their
forms and voices before the eye and ear of flesh, there would be a world
of hallucinations around us.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it wants heaven-sent moments
for this skill,&rdquo; and few bridal nights send a vision and a voice
to the bed of a wakeful lover far away.</p>
<p>Stories of this kind, appearances of the living or dying really at
a distance, might be multiplied to any extent.&nbsp; They are all capable
of explanation, if we admit the theory of telepathy, of a message sent
by an unknown process from one living man&rsquo;s mind to another.&nbsp;
Where more than one person shares the vision, we may suppose that the
influence comes directly from A to B, C and D, or comes from A to B,
and is by him unconsciously &ldquo;wired&rdquo; on to B and C, or is
&ldquo;suggested&rdquo; to them by B&rsquo;s conduct or words.</p>
<p>In that case animals may be equally affected, thus, if B seems alarmed,
that may frighten his dog, or the alarm of a dog, caused by some noise
or smell, heard or smelt by him, may frighten B, C and D, and make one
or all of them see a ghost.</p>
<p>Popular opinion is strongly in favour of beasts seeing ghosts.&nbsp;
The people of St. Kilda, according to Martin, held that cows shared
the visions of second-sighted milk-maids.&nbsp; Horses are said to shy
on the scene of murders.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s horse ran away (home) when
Sir Walter saw the bogle near Ashiestiel.&nbsp; In a case given later
the dog shut up in a room full of unexplained noises, yelled and whined.&nbsp;
The same dog (an intimate friend of my own) bristled up his hair and
growled before his master saw the Grey Lady.&nbsp; The Rev. J. G. Wood
gives a case of a cat which nearly went mad when his mistress saw an
apparition.&nbsp; Jeremy Taylor tells of a dog which got quite used
to a ghost that often appeared to his master, and used to follow it.&nbsp;
In &ldquo;The Lady in Black,&rdquo; a dog would jump up and fawn on
the ghost and then run away in a fright.&nbsp; Mr. Wesley&rsquo;s mastiff
was much alarmed by the family ghost.&nbsp; Not to multiply cases, dogs
and other animals are easily affected by whatever it is that makes people
think a ghost is present, or by the conduct of the human beings on these
occasions.</p>
<p>Absurd as the subject appears, there are stories of the ghosts of
animals.&nbsp; These may be discussed later; meanwhile we pass from
appearances of the living or dying to stories of appearances of the
dead.</p>

<h3>APPEARANCES OF THE DEAD</h3>
<p>We now pass beyond the utmost limits to which a &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;
theory of things ghostly can be pushed.&nbsp; Science admits, if asked,
that it does not know everything.&nbsp; It is not <i>inconceivable</i>
that living minds may communicate by some other channel than that of
the recognised senses.&nbsp; Science now admits the fact of hypnotic
influence, though, sixty years ago, Braid was not allowed to read a
paper on it before the British Association.&nbsp; Even now the topic
is not welcome.&nbsp; But perhaps only one eminent man of science declares
that hypnotism is <i>all</i> imposture and malobservation.&nbsp; Thus
it is not wholly beyond the scope of fancy to imagine that some day
official science may glance at the evidence for &ldquo;telepathy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But the stories we have been telling deal with living men supposed
to be influencing living men.&nbsp; When the dead are alleged to exercise
a similar power, we have to suppose that some consciousness survives
the grave, and manifests itself by causing hallucinations among the
living.&nbsp; Instances of this have already been given in &ldquo;The
Ghost and the Portrait,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bright Scar&rdquo; and &ldquo;Riding
Home after Mess&rdquo;.&nbsp; These were adduced as examples of <i>veracity</i>
in hallucinations.&nbsp; Each appearance gave information to the seer
which he did not previously possess.&nbsp; In the first case, the lady
who saw the soldier and the suppliant did not know of their previous
existence and melancholy adventure.&nbsp; In the second, the brother
did not know that his dead sister&rsquo;s face had been scratched.&nbsp;
In the third, the observer did not know that Lieutenant B. had grown
a beard and acquired a bay pony with black mane and tail.&nbsp; But
though the appearances were <i>veracious</i>, they were <i>purposeless</i>,
and again, as in each case the information existed in living minds,
it <i>may</i> have been wired on from them.</p>
<p>Thus the doctrine of telepathy puts a ghost of the dead in a great
quandary.&nbsp; If he communicates no verifiable information, he may
be explained as a mere empty illusion.&nbsp; If he does yield fresh
information, and if that is known to any living mind, he and his intelligence
may have been wired on from that mind.&nbsp; His only chance is to communicate
facts which are proved to be true, facts which nobody living knew before.&nbsp;
Now it is next to impossible to demonstrate that the facts communicated
were absolutely unknown to everybody.</p>
<p>Far, however, from conveying unknown intelligence, most ghosts convey
none at all, and appear to have no purpose whatever.</p>
<p>It will be observed that there was no traceable reason why the girl
with a scar should appear to Mr. G., or the soldier and suppliant to
Mrs. M., or Lieutenant B. to General Barker.&nbsp; The appearances came
in a vague, casual, aimless way, just as the living and healthy clergyman
appeared to the diplomatist.&nbsp; On St. Augustine&rsquo;s theory the
dead persons who appeared may have known no more about the matter than
did the living clergyman.&nbsp; It is not even necessary to suppose
that the dead man was dreaming about the living person to whom, or about
the place in which, he appeared.&nbsp; But on the analogy of the tales
in which a dream or thought of the living seems to produce a hallucination
of their presence in the minds of other and distant living people, so
a dream of the dead may (it is urged) have a similar effect if &ldquo;in
that sleep of death such dreams may come&rdquo;.&nbsp; The idea occurred
to Shakespeare!&nbsp; In any case the ghosts of our stories hitherto
have been so aimless and purposeless as to resemble what we might imagine
a dead man&rsquo;s dream to be.</p>
<p>This view of the case (that a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; may be a reflection
of a dead man&rsquo;s dream) will become less difficult to understand
if we ask ourselves what natural thing most resembles the common idea
of a ghost.&nbsp; You are reading alone at night, let us say, the door
opens and a human figure glides into the room.&nbsp; To you it pays
no manner of attention; it does not answer if you speak; it may trifle
with some object in the chamber and then steal quietly out again.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is the House-maid walking in her Sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This perfectly accountable appearance, in its aimlessness, its unconsciousness,
its irresponsiveness, is undeniably just like the common notion of a
ghost.&nbsp; Now, if ordinary ghosts are not of flesh and blood, like
the sleep-walking house-maid, yet are as irresponsive, as unconscious,
and as vaguely wandering as she, then (if the dead are somewhat) a ghost
<i>may</i> be a hallucination produced in the living by the <i>unconscious</i>
action of the mind of the dreaming dead.&nbsp; The conception is at
least conceivable.&nbsp; If adopted, merely for argument&rsquo;s sake,
it would first explain the purposeless behaviour of ghosts, and secondly,
relieve people who see ghosts of the impression that they see &ldquo;spirits&rdquo;.&nbsp;
In the Scotch phrase the ghost obviously &ldquo;is not all there,&rdquo;
any more than the sleep walker is intellectually &ldquo;all there&rdquo;.&nbsp;
This incomplete, incoherent presence is just what might be expected
if a dreaming disembodied mind could affect an embodied mind with a
hallucination.</p>
<p>But the good old-fashioned ghost stories are usually of another type.&nbsp;
The robust and earnest ghosts of our ancestors &ldquo;had their own
purpose sun-clear before them,&rdquo; as Mr. Carlyle would have said.&nbsp;
They knew what they wanted, asked for it, and saw that they got it.</p>
<p>As a rule their bodies were unburied, and so they demanded sepulture;
or they had committed a wrong, and wished to make restitution; or they
had left debts which they were anxious to pay; or they had advice, or
warnings, or threats to communicate; or they had been murdered, and
were determined to bring their assassins to the gibbet.</p>
<p>Why, we may ask, were the old ghost stories so different from the
new?&nbsp; Well, first they were not all different.&nbsp; Again, probably
only the more dramatic tales were as a rule recorded.&nbsp; Thirdly,
many of the stories may have been either embellished&mdash;a fancied
purpose being attributed to a purposeless ghost&mdash;or they may even
have been invented to protect witnesses who gave information against
murderers.&nbsp; Who could disobey a ghost?</p>
<p>In any case the old ghost stories are much more dramatic than the
new.&nbsp; To them we turn, beginning with the appearances of Mr. and
Mrs. Furze at Spraiton, in Devonshire, in 1682.&nbsp; Our author is
Mr. Richard Bovet, in his <i>Pand&aelig;monium</i>, <i>or the Devil&rsquo;s
Cloister opened</i> (1683).&nbsp; The motive of the late Mr. Furze was
to have some small debts paid; his wife&rsquo;s spectre was influenced
by a jealousy of Mr. Furze&rsquo;s spectre&rsquo;s relations with another
lady.</p>
<h3>THE DAEMON OF SPRAITON IN DEVON <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111">{111}</a>
ANNO 1682</h3>
<p>&ldquo;About the month of November in the year 1682, in the parish
of Spraiton, in the county of Devon, one Francis Fey (servant to Mr.
Philip Furze) being in a field near the dwelling-house of his said master,
there appeared unto him the <i>resemblance</i> of an <i>aged gentleman</i>
like his master&rsquo;s father, with a pole or staff in his hand, resembling
that he was wont to carry when living to kill the moles withal.&nbsp;
The <i>spectrum</i> approached near the young man, whom you may imagin
not a little surprized at the <i>appearance</i> of one that he knew
to be dead, but the <i>spectrum bid him not be afraid of him</i>, <i>but
tell his master</i> (who was his son) that several <i>legacies which
by his testament he had bequeathed were unpaid</i>, <i>naming ten shillings
to one and ten shillings to another</i>, <i>both which persons he named</i>
to the young man, who replyed that the party he last named was dead,
and so it could not be paid to him.&nbsp; The ghost answered <i>he knew
that</i>, <i>but it must be paid to the next relation</i>, whom he also
named.&nbsp; The spectrum likewise ordered him to carry twenty shillings
to a gentlewoman, sister to the deceased, living near Totness in the
said county, and promised, if these things were performed, to trouble
him no further; but at the same time the <i>spectrum</i>, speaking of
his <i>second wife</i> (who was also dead) <i>called her wicked woman</i>,
though the gentleman who writ the letter knew her and esteemed her a
very good woman.&nbsp; And (having thus related him his mind) the spectrum
left the young man, who according to the <i>direction</i> of the <i>spirit</i>
took care to see the small legacies satisfied, and carried the twenty
shillings that was appointed to be paid the gentlewoman near Totness,
but she utterly refused to receive it, being sent her (as she said)
from the devil.&nbsp; The same night the young man lodging at her house,
the aforesaid spectrum appeared to him again; whereupon the young man
challenged his <i>promise not to trouble him any more</i>, saying he
had performed all according to his appointment, but that the gentlewoman,
his sister, would not receive the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>To which the spectrum replied that was true indeed</i>;
but withal <i>directed</i> the young man to ride to <i>Totness</i> and
buy for her <i>a ring of that value</i>, <i>which the spirit said she
would accept of</i>, which being provided accordingly, she received.&nbsp;
Since the performance of which the ghost or apparition of the old gentleman
hath seemed to be at rest, having never given the young man any further
trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the next day after having delivered the ring, the young
man was riding home to his master&rsquo;s house, accompanyed by a servant
of the gentlewoman&rsquo;s near <i>Totness</i>, and near about the time
of their entrance (or a little before they came) into the parish of
<i>Spraiton</i> aforesaid, there appeared to be upon the horse behind
the young man, the resemblance of the <i>second wife</i> of the old
gentleman spoken of before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This daemon often threw the young man off his horse, and cast
him with such violence to the ground as was great astonishment, not
only to the gentlewoman&rsquo;s servant (with him), but to divers others
who were spectators of the frightful action, the ground resounding with
great noise by reason of the incredible force with which he was cast
upon it.&nbsp; At his coming into his master&rsquo;s yard, the horse
which he rid, though very poor and out of case, leaped at one spring
twenty-five foot, to the amazement of all that saw it.&nbsp; Soon after
the she-spectre shewed herself to divers in the house, <i>viz</i>.,
the aforesaid young man, <i>Mistress Thomasin Gidly</i>, <i>Ann Langdon</i>,
born in that parish, and a little child, which, by reason of the troublesomeness
of the spirit, they were fain to remove from that house.&nbsp; She appeared
sometimes in her own shape, sometimes in forms very horrid; now and
then like a monstrous dog belching out fire; at another time it flew
out at the window, in the shape of a horse, carrying with it only one
pane of glass and a small piece of iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One time the young man&rsquo;s head was thrust into a very
strait place betwixt a bed&rsquo;s head and a wall, and forced by the
strength of divers men to be removed thence, and that not without being
much hurt and bruised, so that much blood appeared about it: upon this
it was advised he should be bleeded, to prevent any ill accident that
might come of the bruise; after bleeding, the ligature or binder of
his arm was removed from thence and conveyed about his middle, where
it was strained with such violence that the girding had almost stopp&rsquo;d
his breath and kill&rsquo;d him, and being cut asunder it made <i>a
strange and dismal noise</i>, so that the standers by were affrighted
at it.&nbsp; At divers other times he hath been in danger to be strangled
with cravats and handkerchiefs that he hath worn about his neck, which
have been drawn so close that with the sudden violence he hath near
been choaked, and hardly escaped death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spectre hath shewed great offence at the perriwigs which
the young man used to wear, for they are often torn from his head after
a very strange manner; one that he esteemed above the rest he put in
a small box, and that box he placed in another, which he set against
the wall of his chamber, placing a joint-stool with other weight a top
of it, but in short time the boxes were broken in sunder and the perriwig
rended into many small parts and tatters.&nbsp; Another time, lying
in his master&rsquo;s chamber with his perriwig on his head, to secure
it from danger, within a little time it was torn from him and reduced
into very small fragments.&nbsp; At another time one of his shoe-strings
was observed (without the assistance of any hand) to come of its own
accord out of its shoe and fling itself to the other side of the room;
the other was crawling after it, but a maid espying that, with her hand
drew it out, and it strangely <i>clasp&rsquo;d</i> and <i>curl&rsquo;d</i>
about her hand like a living <i>eel</i> or <i>serpent</i>; this is testified
by a lady of considerable quality, too great for exception, who was
an eye-witness.&nbsp; The same lady shewed Mr. C. one of the young man&rsquo;s
gloves, which was torn in his pocket while she was by, which is so dexterously
tatter&rsquo;d and so artificially torn that it is conceived a cutler
could not have contrived an instrument to have laid it abroad so accurately,
and all this was done in the pocket in the compass of one minute.&nbsp;
It is further observable that if the aforesaid young man, or another
person who is a servant maid in the house, do wear their own clothes,
they are certainly torn in pieces on their backs, but if the clothes
belong to any other, they are not injured after that manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many other strange and fantastical freaks have been done by
the said daemon or spirit in the view of divers persons; a barrel of
salt of considerable quantity hath been observed to march from room
to room without any human assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hand-iron hath seemed to lay itself cross over-thwart a
pan of milk that hath been scalding over the fire, and two flitches
of bacon have of their own accord descended from the chimney where they
were hung, and placed themselves upon the hand-iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the spectre appears in resemblance of her own person,
she seems to be habited in the same cloaths and dress which the gentlewoman
of the house (her daughter-in-law) hath on at the same time.&nbsp; Divers
times the feet and legs of the young man aforesaid have been so entangled
about his neck that he hath been loosed with great difficulty; sometimes
they have been so twisted about the frames of chairs and stools that
they have hardly been set at liberty.&nbsp; But one of the most considerable
instances of the malice of the spirit against the young man happened
on Easter Eve, when Mrs. C. the relator, was passing by the door of
the house, and it was thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the young man was returning from his labour, he was taken
up by the <i>skirt</i> of his <i>doublet</i> by this <i>female daemon</i>,
and carried a height into the air.&nbsp; He was soon missed by his Master
and some other servants that had been at labour with him, and after
diligent enquiry no news could be heard of him, until at length (near
half an hour after) he was heard singing and whistling in a bog or quagmire,
where they found him in a kind of trance or <i>extatick fit</i>, to
which he hath sometimes been accustomed (but whether before the affliction
he met with from this spirit I am not certain).&nbsp; He was affected
much after such sort, as at the time of those <i>fits</i>, so that the
people did not give that <i>attention</i> and <i>regard</i> to what
he said as at other times; but when he returned again to himself (which
was about an hour after) he solemnly protested to them that the daemon
had carried him so high that his master&rsquo;s house seemed to him
to be but <i>as a hay-cock</i>, and <i>that during all that time he
was in perfect sense</i>, <i>and prayed to Almighty God not to suffer
the devil to destroy him</i>; and that he was suddenly set down in that
quagmire.</p>
<p>The workmen found one shoe on one side of his master&rsquo;s house,
and the other on the other side, and in the morning espied his perriwig
hanging on the top of a tree; by which it appears he had been carried
a considerable height, and that what he told them was not a fiction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this it was observed that that part of the young man&rsquo;s
body which had been on the mud in the quagmire was somewhat benummbed
and seemingly deader than the other, whereupon the following <i>Saturday</i>,
which was the day before <i>Low Sunday</i>, he was carried to <i>Crediton</i>,
<i>alias Kirton</i>, to be bleeded, which being done accordingly, and
the company having left him for some little space, at their return they
found him in one of his fits, with his <i>forehead</i> much <i>bruised</i>,
and <i>swoln</i> to a <i>great bigness</i>, none being able to guess
how it happened, until his recovery from that <i>fit</i>, when upon
enquiry he gave them this account of it: <i>that a bird had with great
swiftness and force flown in at the window with a stone in its beak</i>,
<i>which it had dashed against his forehead</i>, <i>which had occasioned
the swelling which they saw.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The people much wondering at the strangeness of the accident,
diligently sought the stone, and under the place where he sat they found
not such a stone as they expected but a weight of brass or copper, which
it seems the daemon had made use of on that occasion to give the poor
young man that hurt in his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The persons present were at the trouble to break it to pieces,
every one taking a part and preserving it in memory of so strange an
accident.&nbsp; After this the spirit continued to molest the young
man in a very severe and rugged manner, often handling him with great
extremity, and whether it hath yet left its violences to him, or whether
the young man be yet alive, I can have no certain account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I leave the reader to consider of the extraordinary strangeness of
the relation.</p>
<p>The reader, considering the exceeding strangeness of the relation,
will observe that we have now reached &ldquo;great swingeing falsehoods,&rdquo;
even if that opinion had not hitherto occurred to his mind.&nbsp; But
if he thinks that such stories are no longer told, and even sworn to
on Bible oath, he greatly deceives himself.&nbsp; In the chapter on
&ldquo;Haunted Houses&rdquo; he will find statements just as hard narrated
of the years 1870 and 1882.&nbsp; In these, however, the ghosts had
no purpose but mischief. <a name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118">{118}</a></p>
<p>We take another &ldquo;ghost with a purpose&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>SIR GEORGE VILLIERS&rsquo; GHOST.</h3>
<p>The variations in the narratives of Sir George Villiers&rsquo; appearance
to an old servant of his, or old <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, and the
warning communicated by this man to Villiers&rsquo; son, the famous
Duke of Buckingham, are curious and instructive.&nbsp; The tale is first
told in print by William Lilly, the astrologer, in the second part of
a large tract called <i>Monarchy or No Monarchy in England</i> (London,
1651), twenty-three years after Buckingham&rsquo;s murder.&nbsp; But
while prior in publication, Lilly&rsquo;s story was probably written
after, though independent of Lord Clarendon&rsquo;s, in the first book
of his <i>History of the Rebellion</i>, begun on 18th March, 1646, that
is within eighteen years of the events.&nbsp; Clarendon, of course,
was in a position to know what was talked of at the time.&nbsp; Next,
we have a letter of Mr. Douch to Glanvil, undated, but written after
the Restoration, and, finally, an original manuscript of 1652.</p>
<p>Douch makes the warning arrive &ldquo;some few days&rdquo; before
the murder of Buckingham, and says that the ghost of Sir George, &ldquo;in
his morning gown,&rdquo; bade one Parker tell Buckingham to abandon
the expedition to La Rochelle or expect to be murdered.&nbsp; On the
third time of appearing the vision pulled a long knife from under his
gown, as a sign of the death awaiting Buckingham.&nbsp; He also communicated
a &ldquo;private token&rdquo; to Parker, the &ldquo;percipient,&rdquo;
Sir George&rsquo;s old servant.&nbsp; On each occasion of the appearance,
Parker was reading at midnight.&nbsp; Parker, <i>after</i> the murder,
told one Ceeley, who told it to a clergyman, who told Douch, who told
Glanvil.</p>
<p>In Lilly&rsquo;s version the ghost had a habit of walking in Parker&rsquo;s
room, and finally bade him tell Buckingham to abstain from certain company,
&ldquo;or else he will come to destruction, and that suddenly&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Parker, thinking he had dreamed, did nothing; the ghost reappeared,
and communicated a secret &ldquo;which he (Buckingham) knows that none
in the world ever knew but myself and he&rdquo;.&nbsp; The duke, on
hearing the story from Parker, backed by the secret, was amazed, but
did not alter his conduct.&nbsp; On the third time the spectre produced
the knife, but at <i>this</i> information the duke only laughed.&nbsp;
Six weeks later he was stabbed.&nbsp; Douch makes the whole affair pass
immediately before the assassination.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Mr. Parker died
soon after,&rdquo; as the ghost had foretold to him.</p>
<p>Finally, Clarendon makes the appearances set in six months before
Felton slew the duke.&nbsp; The percipient, unnamed, was in bed.&nbsp;
The narrative now develops new features; the token given on the ghost&rsquo;s
third coming obviously concerns Buckingham&rsquo;s mother, the Countess,
the &ldquo;one person more&rdquo; who knew the secret communicated.&nbsp;
The ghost produces no knife from under his gown; no warning of Buckingham&rsquo;s
death by violence is mentioned.&nbsp; A note in the MS. avers that Clarendon
himself had papers bearing on the subject, and that he got his information
from Sir Ralph Freeman (who introduced the unnamed percipient to the
duke), and from some of Buckingham&rsquo;s servants, &ldquo;who were
informed of much of it before the murder of the duke&rdquo;.&nbsp; Clarendon
adds that, in general, &ldquo;no man looked on relations of that sort
with less reverence and consideration&rdquo; than he did.&nbsp; This
anecdote he selects out of &ldquo;many stories scattered abroad at the
time&rdquo; as &ldquo;upon a better foundation of credit&rdquo;.&nbsp;
The percipient was an officer in the king&rsquo;s wardrobe at Windsor,
&ldquo;of a good reputation for honesty and discretion,&rdquo; and aged
about fifty.&nbsp; He was bred at a school in Sir George&rsquo;s parish,
and as a boy was kindly treated by Sir George, &ldquo;whom afterwards
he never saw&rdquo;.&nbsp; On first beholding the spectre in his room,
the seer recognised Sir George&rsquo;s costume, then antiquated.&nbsp;
At last the seer went to Sir Ralph Freeman, who introduced him to the
duke on a hunting morning at Lambeth Bridge.&nbsp; They talked earnestly
apart, observed by Sir Ralph, Clarendon&rsquo;s informant.&nbsp; The
duke seemed abstracted all day; left the field early, sought his mother,
and after a heated conference of which the sounds reached the ante-room,
went forth in visible trouble and anger, a thing never before seen in
him after talk with his mother.&nbsp; She was found &ldquo;overwhelmed
with tears and in the highest agony imaginable&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is a notorious truth&rdquo; that, when told of his murder, &ldquo;she
seemed not in the least degree surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following curious manuscript account of the affair is, after
the prefatory matter, the copy of a letter dated 1652.&nbsp; There is
nothing said of a ghostly knife, the name of the seer is not Parker,
and in its whole effect the story tallies with Clarendon&rsquo;s version,
though the narrator knows nothing of the scene with the Countess of
Buckingham.</p>
<h3>CAVALIER VERSION <a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121">{121}</a></h3>
<p>&ldquo;1627.&nbsp; Since William Lilly the Rebells Jugler and Mountebank
in his malicious and blaspheamous discourse concerning our late Martyred
Soveraigne of ever blessed memory (amongst other lyes and falsehoods)
imprinted a relation concerning an Aparition which foretold several
Events which should happen to the Duke of Buckingham, wherein he falsifies
boeth the person to whom it appeared and ye circumstances; I thought
it not amis to enter here (that it may be preserved) the true account
of that Aparition as I have receaved it from the hande and under the
hande of Mr. Edmund Wyndham, of Kellefford in the County of Somersett.&nbsp;
I shall sett it downe (<i>ipsissimis verbis</i>) as he delivered it
to me at my request written with his own hande.</p>
<h3>WYNDHAM&rsquo;S LETTER</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sr.&nbsp; According to your desire and my promise I have written
down what I remember (divers things being slipt out of my memory) of
the relation made me by Mr. Nicholas Towse concerning the Aparition
wch visited him.&nbsp; About ye yeare 1627, <a name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122">{122}</a>
I and my wife upon an occasion being in London lay att my Brother Pyne&rsquo;s
house without Bishopsgate, wch. was ye next house unto Mr. Nicholas
Towse&rsquo;s, who was my Kinsman and familiar acquaintance, in consideration
of whose Society and friendship he tooke a house in that place, ye said
Towse being a very fine Musician and very good company, and for ought
I ever saw or heard, a Vurtuous, religious and wel disposed Gentleman.&nbsp;
About that time ye said Mr. Towse tould me that one night, being in
Bed and perfectly waking, and a Candle burning by him (as he usually
had) there came into his Chamber and stood by his bed side an Olde Gentleman
in such an habitt as was in fashion in Q: Elizebeth&rsquo;s tyme, at
whose first appearance Mr. Towse was very much troubled, but after a
little tyme, recollecting himselfe, he demanded of him in ye Name of
God what he was, whether he were a Man.&nbsp; And ye Aparition replyed
No.&nbsp; Then he asked him if he were a Divell.&nbsp; And ye answer
was No.&nbsp; Then Mr. Towse said &lsquo;in ye Name of God, what art
thou then?&rsquo;&nbsp; And as I remember Mr. Towse told me that ye
Apparition answered him that he was ye Ghost of Sir George Villiers,
Father to ye then Duke of Buckingham, whom he might very well remember,
synce he went to schoole at such a place in Leicestershire (naming ye
place which I have forgotten).&nbsp; And Mr. Towse tould me that ye
Apparition had perfectly ye resemblance of ye said Sr George Villiers
in all respects and in ye same habitt that he had often seene him weare
in his lifetime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The said Apparition then tould Mr. Towse that he could not
but remember ye much kindness that he, ye said Sr George Villiers, had
expressed to him whilst he was a Schollar in Leicestershire, as aforesaid,
and that as out of that consideration he believed that he loved him
and that therefore he made choyce of him, ye sayde Mr. Towse, to deliver
a message to his sonne, ye Duke of Buckingham; thereby to prevent such
mischiefe as would otherwise befall ye said Duke whereby he would be
inevitably ruined.&nbsp; And then (as I remember) Mr. Towse tould me
that ye Apparition instructed him what message he should deliver unto
ye Duke.&nbsp; Vnto wch. Mr. Towse replyed that he should be very unwilling
to goe to ye Duke of Buckingham upon such an errand, whereby he should
gaine nothing but reproach and contempt, and to be esteemed a Madman,
and therefore desired to be exscused from ye employment, but ye Apparition
pressd him wth. much earnestness to undertake it, telling him that ye
Circumstances and secret Discoveries which he should be able to make
to ye Duke of such passages in ye course of his life which were known
to none but himselfe, would make it appeare that ye message was not
ye fancy of a Distempered Brayne, but a reality, and so ye Apparition
tooke his leave of him for that night and telling him that he would
give him leave to consider till the next night, and then he would come
to receave his answer wheather he would undertake to deliver his message
or no.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Towse past that day wth. much trouble and perplexity,
debating and reasoning wth. himselfe wether he should deliver his message
or not to ye Duke but, in ye conclusion, he resolved to doe it, and
ye next night when ye Apparition came he gave his answer accordingly,
and then receaved his full instruction.&nbsp; After which Mr. Towse
went and founde out Sr. Thomas Bludder and Sr. Ralph Freeman, by whom
he was brought to ye Duke of Buckingham, and had sevarall private and
lone audiences of him, I my selfe, by ye favoure of a freinde (Sr. Edward
Savage) was once admitted to see him in private conference with ye Duke,
where (although I heard not there discourses) I observed much earnestnessse
in their actions and gestures.&nbsp; After wch. conference Mr. Towse
tould me that ye Duke would not follow ye advice that was given him,
which was (as I remember) that he intimated ye casting of, and ye rejecting
of some Men who had great interest in him, which was, and as I take
it he named, Bp. Laud and that ye Duke was to doe some popular Acts
in ye ensuing Parliament, of which Parliament ye Duke would have had
Mr. Towse to have been a Burgesse, but he refused it, alleadging that
unlesse ye Duke followed his directions, he must doe him hurt if he
were of ye Parliament.&nbsp; Mr. Towse then toalde that ye Duke of Buckingham
confessed that he had toalde him those things wch. no Creature knew
but himself, and that none but God or ye Divell could reveale to him.&nbsp;
Ye Duke offered Mr. Towse to have ye King knight him, and to have given
him preferment (as he tould me), but that he refused it, saying that
vnless he would follow his advice he would receave nothing from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Towse, when he made me this relation, he tolde me that
ye Duke would inevitably be destroyed before such a time (wch. he then
named) and accordingly ye Duke&rsquo;s death happened before that time.&nbsp;
He likewise tolde that he had written downe all ye severall discourses
that he had had wth. ye Apparition, and that at last his coming was
so familiar that he was as litle troubled with it as if it had beene
a friende or acquayntance that had come to visitt him.&nbsp; Mr. Towse
told me further that ye Archbishop of Canterbury, then Bishop of London,
Dr. Laud, should by his Councells be ye authoure of very great troubles
to ye Kingdome, by which it should be reduced to ye extremity of disorder
and confusion, and that it should seeme to be past all hope of recovery
without a miracle, but when all people were in dispayre of seeing happy
days agayne, ye Kingdome should suddenly be reduced and resettled agayne
in a most happy condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this tyme my father Pyne was in trouble and comitted to
ye Gatehouse by ye Lords of ye Councell about a Quarrel betweene him
and ye Lord Powlett, upon which one night I saide to my Cosin Towse,
by way of jest, &lsquo;I pray aske your Appairition what shall become
of my father Pyne&rsquo;s business,&rsquo; which he promised to doe,
and ye next day he tolde me that my father Pyne&rsquo;s enemyes were
ashamed of their malicious prosecution, and that he would be at liberty
within a week or some few days, which happened according.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Towse, his wife, since his death tolde me that her husband
and she living at Windsor Castle, where he had an office that Sumer
that ye Duke of Buckingham was killed, tolde her that very day that
the Duke was sett upon by ye mutinous Mariners att Portesmouth, saying
then that ye next attempt agaynst him would be his Death, which accordingly
happened.&nbsp; And att ye instant ye Duke was killed (as she vnderstood
by ye relation afterwards) Mr. Towse was sitting in his chayre, out
of which he suddenly started vp and sayd, &lsquo;Wyfe, ye Duke of Buckingham
is slayne!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Towse lived not long after that himselfe, but tolde his
wife ye tyme of his Death before itt happened.&nbsp; I never saw him
after I had seen some effects of his discourse, which before I valued
not, and therefore was not curious to enquire after more than he voluntaryly
tolde me, which I then entertayned not wth. these serious thoughts which
I have synce reflected on in his discourse.&nbsp; This is as much as
I can remember on this business which, according to youre desire, is
written by</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sr. Yor., &amp;c.,</p>
<p>&ldquo;EDMUND WINDHAM.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BOULOGNE, 5<i>th August</i>, 1652.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>This version has, over all others, the merit of being written by
an acquaintance of the seer, who was with him while the appearances
were going on.&nbsp; The narrator was also present at an interview between
the seer and Buckingham.&nbsp; His mention of Sir Ralph Freeman tallies
with Clarendon&rsquo;s, who had the story from Freeman.&nbsp; The ghost
predicts the Restoration, and this is recorded before that happy event.&nbsp;
Of course Mr. Towse may have been interested in Buckingham&rsquo;s career
and may have invented the ghost (after discovering the secret token)
<a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127">{127}</a> as an excuse
for warning him.</p>
<p>The reader can now take his choice among versions of Sir George Villiers&rsquo;
ghost.&nbsp; He must remember that, in 1642, Sir Henry Wotton &ldquo;spent
some inquiry whether the duke had any ominous presagement before his
end,&rdquo; but found no evidence.&nbsp; Sir Henry told Izaak Walton
a story of a dream of an ancestor of his own, whereby some robbers of
the University chest at Oxford were brought to justice.&nbsp; Anthony
Wood consulted the records of the year mentioned, and found no trace
of any such robbery.&nbsp; We now approach a yet more famous ghost than
Sir George&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This is Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
ghost had a purpose, to warn that bad man of his death, but nobody knows
whose ghost she was!</p>
<h3>LORD LYTTELTON&rsquo;S GHOST</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;it is the most extraordinary
thing that has happened in my day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s day
included the rising of 1745 and of the Wesleyans, the seizure of Canada,
the Seven Years&rsquo; War, the American Rebellion, the Cock Lane ghost,
and other singular occurrences, but &ldquo;the most extraordinary thing&rdquo;
was&mdash;Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s ghost!&nbsp; Famous as is that spectre,
nobody knows what it was, nor even whether there was any spectre at
all.</p>
<p>Thomas, Lord Lyttelton, was born in 1744.&nbsp; In 1768 he entered
the House of Commons.&nbsp; In 1769 he was unseated for bribery.&nbsp;
He then vanishes from public view, probably he was playing the prodigal
at home and abroad, till February, 1772, when he returned to his father&rsquo;s
house, and married.&nbsp; He then went abroad (with a barmaid) till
1773, when his father died.&nbsp; In January, 1774, he took his seat
in the House of Lords.&nbsp; In November, 1779, Lyttelton went into
Opposition.&nbsp; On Thursday, 25th November, he denounced Government
in a magnificent speech.&nbsp; As to a sinecure which he held, he said,
&ldquo;Perhaps I shall not keep it long!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Something had Happened</i>!</p>
<p>On the night before his speech, that of Wednesday, 24th November,
Lyttelton had seen the ghost, and had been told that he would die in
three days.&nbsp; He mentioned this to Rowan Hamilton on the Friday.
<a name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a">{129a}</a>&nbsp;
On the same day, or on Friday, he mentioned it to Captain Ascough, who
told a lady, who told Mrs. Thrale. <a name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b">{129b}</a>&nbsp;
On the Friday he went to Epsom with friends, and mentioned the ghost
to them, among others to Mr. Fortescue. <a name="citation129c"></a><a href="#footnote129c">{129c}</a>&nbsp;
About midnight on 28th November, Lord Lyttelton died suddenly in bed,
his valet having left him for a moment to fetch a spoon for stirring
his medicine.&nbsp; The cause of death was not stated; there was no
inquest.</p>
<p>This, literally, is all that is <i>known</i> about Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s
ghost.&nbsp; It is variously described as: (1) &ldquo;a young woman
and a robin&rdquo; (Horace Walpole); (2) &ldquo;a spirit&rdquo; (Captain
Ascough); (3) a bird in a dream, &ldquo;which changed into a woman in
white&rdquo; (Lord Westcote&rsquo;s narrative of 13th February, 1780,
collected from Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s guests and servants); (4) &ldquo;a
bird turning into a woman&rdquo; (Mrs. Delany, 9th December, 1779);
(5) a dream of a bird, followed by a woman, Mrs. Amphlett, in white
(Pitt Place archives after 1789); (6) &ldquo;a fluttering noise, as
of a bird, followed by the apparition of a woman who had committed suicide
after being seduced by Lyttelton&rdquo; (Lady Lyttelton, 1828); (7)
a bird &ldquo;which vanished when a female spirit in white raiment presented
herself&rdquo; (<i>Scots Magazine</i>, November-December, 1779).</p>
<p>Out of seven versions, a bird, or a fluttering noise as of a bird
(a common feature in ghost stories), <a name="citation130a"></a><a href="#footnote130a">{130a}</a>
with a woman following or accompanying, occurs in six.&nbsp; The phenomena
are almost equally ascribed to dreaming and to waking hallucination,
but the common-sense of the eighteenth century called all ghosts &ldquo;dreams&rdquo;.&nbsp;
In the Westcote narrative (1780) Lyttelton explains the dream by his
having lately been in a room with a lady, Mrs. Dawson, when a robin
flew in.&nbsp; Yet, in the same narrative, Lyttelton says on Saturday
morning &ldquo;that he was very well, and believed he should bilk the
<i>ghost</i>&rdquo;.&nbsp; He was certainly in bed at the time of the
experience, and probably could not be sure whether he was awake or asleep.
<a name="citation130b"></a><a href="#footnote130b">{130b}</a></p>
<p>Considering the remoteness of time, the story is very well recorded.&nbsp;
It is chronicled by Mrs. Thrale before the news of Lyttelton&rsquo;s
death reached her, and by Lady Mary Coke two days later, by Walpole
on the day after the peer&rsquo;s decease, of which he had heard.&nbsp;
Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s health had for some time been bad; he had made
his will a few weeks before, and his nights were horror-haunted.&nbsp;
A little boy, his nephew, to whom he was kind, used to find the wicked
lord sitting by his bed at night, because he dared not be alone.&nbsp;
So Lockhart writes to his daughter, Mrs. Hope Scott. <a name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131">{131}</a>&nbsp;
He had strange dreams of being in hell with the cruel murderess, Mrs.
Brownrigg, who &ldquo;whipped three female &rsquo;prentices to death
and hid them in the coal-hole&rdquo;.&nbsp; Such a man might have strange
fancies, and a belief in approaching death might bring its own fulfilment.&nbsp;
The hypothesis of a premeditated suicide, with the story of the ghost
as a last practical joke, has no corroboration.&nbsp; It occurred to
Horace Walpole at once, but he laid no stress on it.</p>
<p>Such is a plain, dry, statistical account of the most extraordinary
event that happened in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>However, the story does not end here.&nbsp; On the fatal night, 27th
November, 1779, Mr. Andrews, M.P., a friend of Lyttelton&rsquo;s was
awakened by finding Lord Lyttelton drawing his curtains.&nbsp; Suspecting
a practical joke, he hunted for his lordship both in his house and in
the garden.&nbsp; Of course he never found him.&nbsp; The event was
promptly recorded in the next number of the <i>Scots Magazine</i>, December,
1779. <a name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132">{132}</a></p>

<p>Much later in time than the ghost of Sir George Villiers is the ghost
of Sergeant Davies, of Guise&rsquo;s regiment.&nbsp; His purpose was,
first, to get his body buried; next, to bring his murderers to justice.&nbsp;
In this latter desire he totally failed.</p>
<h3>THE SLAYING OF SERGEANT DAVIES</h3>
<p>We now examine a ghost with a purpose; he wanted to have his bones
buried.&nbsp; The Highlands, in spite of Culloden, were not entirely
pacified in the year 1749.&nbsp; Broken men, robbers, fellows with wrongs
unspeakable to revenge, were out in the heather.&nbsp; The hills that
seemed so lonely were not bare of human life.&nbsp; A man was seldom
so solitary but that eyes might be on him from cave, corry, wood, or
den.&nbsp; The Disarming Act had been obeyed in the usual style: old
useless weapons were given up to the military.&nbsp; But the spirit
of the clans was not wholly broken.&nbsp; Even the old wife of Donald
Ban, when he was &ldquo;sair hadden down by a Bodach&rdquo; (ghost)
asked the spirit to answer one question, &ldquo;Will the Prince come
again?&rdquo;&nbsp; The song expressed the feelings of the people:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The wind has left me bare indeed,<br />
And blawn my bonnet off my heid,<br />
But something&rsquo;s hid in Hieland brae,<br />
The wind&rsquo;s no blawn my sword away!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traffickers came and went from Prince Charles to Cluny, from Charles
in the Convent of St. Joseph to Cluny lurking on Ben Alder.&nbsp; Kilt
and tartan were worn at the risk of life or liberty, in short, the embers
of the rising were not yet extinct.</p>
<p>At this time, in the summer of 1749, Sergeant Arthur Davies, of Guise&rsquo;s
regiment, marched with eight privates from Aberdeen to Dubrach in Braemar,
while a corporal&rsquo;s guard occupied the Spital of Glenshee, some
eight miles away.&nbsp; &ldquo;A more waste tract of mountain and bog,
rocks and ravines, without habitations of any kind till you reach Glenclunie,
is scarce to be met with in Scotland,&rdquo; says Sir Walter.</p>
<p>The sergeant&rsquo;s business was the general surveillance of the
country side.&nbsp; He was a kindly prosperous man, liked in the country,
fond of children, newly married, and his wife bore witness &ldquo;that
he and she lived together in as great amity and love as any couple could
do, and that he never was in use to stay away a night from her&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The sergeant had saved fifteen guineas and a half; he carried the
gold in a green silk purse, and was not averse to displaying it.&nbsp;
He wore a silver watch, and two gold rings, one with a peculiar knob
on the bezel.&nbsp; He had silver buckles to his brogues, silver knee-buckles,
two dozen silver buttons on a striped lute-string waistcoat, and he
carried a gun, a present from an officer in his regiment.&nbsp; His
dress, on the fatal 28th of September, was &ldquo;a blue surtout coat,
with a striped silk vest, and <i>teiken</i> breeches and brown stockings&rdquo;.&nbsp;
His hair, of &ldquo;a dark mouse colour,&rdquo; was worn in a silk ribbon,
his hat was silver laced, and bore his initials cut in the felt.&nbsp;
Thus attired, &ldquo;a pretty man,&rdquo; Sergeant Davies said good-bye
to his wife, who never saw him again, and left his lodgings at Michael
Farquharson&rsquo;s early on 28th September.&nbsp; He took four men
with him, and went to meet the patrol from Glenshee.&nbsp; On the way
he met John Growar in Glenclunie, who spoke with him &ldquo;about a
tartan coat, which the sergeant had observed him to drop, and after
strictly enjoining him not to use it again, dismissed him, instead of
making him prisoner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This encounter was after Davies left his men, before meeting the
patrol, it being his intention to cross the hill and try for a shot
at a stag.</p>
<p>The sergeant never rejoined his men or met the patrol!&nbsp; He vanished
as if the fairies had taken him.&nbsp; His captain searched the hill
with a band of men four days after the disappearance, but to no avail.&nbsp;
Various rumours ran about the country, among others a clatter that Davies
had been killed by Duncan Clerk and Alexander Bain Macdonald.&nbsp;
But the body was undiscovered.</p>
<p>In June, one Alexander Macpherson came to Donald Farquharson, son
of the man with whom Davies had been used to lodge.&nbsp; Macpherson
(who was living in a sheiling or summer hut of shepherds on the hills)
said that he &ldquo;was greatly troubled by the ghost of Sergeant Davies,
who insisted that he should bury his bones, and that, he having declined
to bury them, the ghost insisted that he should apply to Donald Farquharson&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Farquharson &ldquo;could not believe this,&rdquo; till Macpherson invited
him to come and see the bones.&nbsp; Then Farquharson went with the
other, &ldquo;as he thought it might possibly be true, and if it was,
he did not know but the apparition might trouble himself&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The bones were found in a peat moss, about half a mile from the road
taken by the patrols.&nbsp; There, too, lay the poor sergeant&rsquo;s
mouse-coloured hair, with rags of his blue cloth and his brogues, without
the silver buckles, and there did Farquharson and Macpherson bury them
all.</p>
<p>Alexander Macpherson, in his evidence at the trial, declared that,
late in May, 1750, &ldquo;when he was in bed, a vision appeared to him
as of a man clothed in blue, who said, &lsquo;<i>I am Sergeant Davies</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;.&nbsp;
At first Macpherson thought the figure was &ldquo;a real living man,&rdquo;
a brother of Donald Farquharson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He therefore rose and
followed his visitor to the door, where the ghost indicated the position
of his bones, and said that Donald Farquharson would help to inter them.&nbsp;
Macpherson next day found the bones, and spoke to Growar, the man of
the tartan coat (as Growar admitted at the trial).&nbsp; Growar said
if Macpherson did not hold his tongue, he himself would inform Shaw
of Daldownie.&nbsp; Macpherson therefore went straight to Daldownie,
who advised him to bury the bones privily, not to give the country a
bad name for a rebel district.&nbsp; While Macpherson was in doubt,
and had not yet spoken to Farquharson, the ghost revisited him at night
and repeated his command.&nbsp; He also denounced his murderers, Clerk
and Macdonald, which he had declined to do on his first appearance.&nbsp;
He spoke in Gaelic, which, it seems, was a language not known by the
sergeant.</p>
<p>Isobel MacHardie, in whose service Macpherson was, deponed that one
night in summer, June, 1750, while she lay at one end of the sheiling
(a hill hut for shepherds or neatherds) and Macpherson lay at the other,
&ldquo;she saw something naked come in at the door, which frighted her
so much that she drew the clothes over her head.&nbsp; That when it
appeared it came in in a bowing posture, and that next morning she asked
Macpherson what it was that had troubled them in the night before.&nbsp;
To which he answered that she might be easy, for it would not trouble
them any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was in 1750, but Clerk and Macdonald were not arrested till
September, 1753.&nbsp; They were then detained in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh
on various charges, as of wearing the kilt, till June, 1754, when they
were tried, Grant of Prestongrange prosecuting, aided by Haldane, Home
and Dundas, while Lockhart and Mackintosh defended.&nbsp; It was proved
that Clerk&rsquo;s wife wore Davies&rsquo;s ring, that Clerk, after
the murder, had suddenly become relatively rich and taken a farm, and
that the two men, armed, were on the hill near the scene of the murder
on 28th September, 1749.&nbsp; Moreover, Angus Cameron swore that he
saw the murder committed.&nbsp; His account of his position was curious.&nbsp;
He and another Cameron, since dead, were skulking near sunset in a little
hollow on the hill of Galcharn.&nbsp; There he had skulked all day,
&ldquo;waiting for Donald Cameron, <i>who was afterwards hanged</i>,
together with some of the said Donald&rsquo;s companions from Lochaber&rdquo;.&nbsp;
No doubt they were all honest men who had been &ldquo;out,&rdquo; and
they may well have been on Cluny&rsquo;s business of conveying gold
from the Loch Arkaig hoard to Major Kennedy for the prince.</p>
<p>On seeing Clerk and Macdonald strike and shoot the man in the silver-laced
hat, Cameron and his companion ran away, nor did Cameron mention the
matter till nine months later, and then only to Donald (not he who was
hanged).&nbsp; Donald advised him to hold his tongue.&nbsp; This Donald
corroborated at the trial.&nbsp; The case against Clerk and Macdonald
looked very black, especially as some witnesses fled and declined to
appear.&nbsp; Scott, who knew Macintosh, the counsel for the prisoners,
says that their advocates and agent &ldquo;were convinced of their guilt&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Yet a jury of Edinburgh tradesmen, moved by Macintosh&rsquo;s banter
of the apparition, acquitted the accused solely, as Scott believes,
because of the ghost and its newly-learned Gaelic.&nbsp; It is indeed
extraordinary that Prestongrange, the patron of David Balfour, allowed
his witnesses to say what the ghost said, which certainly &ldquo;is
not evidence&rdquo;.&nbsp; Sir Walter supposes that Macpherson and Mrs.
MacHardie invented the apparition as an excuse for giving evidence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The ghost&rsquo;s commands, according to Highland belief, were
not to be disobeyed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Macpherson must have known the facts
&ldquo;by ordinary means&rdquo;.&nbsp; We have seen that Clerk and Macdonald
were at once suspected; there was &ldquo;a clatter&rdquo; against them.&nbsp;
But Angus Cameron had not yet told his tale of what he saw.&nbsp; Then
who <i>did</i> tell?&nbsp; Here comes in a curious piece of evidence
of the year 1896.&nbsp; A friend writes (29th December, 1896):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR LANG,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enclose a tradition connected with the murder of Sergeant
Davies, which my brother picked up lately before he had read the story
in your Cock Lane.&nbsp; He had heard of the event before, both in Athole
and Braemar, and it was this that made him ask the old lady (see next
letter) about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks that Glenconie of your version (p. 256) must be
Glenclunie, into which Allt Chriostaidh falls.&nbsp; He also suggests
that the person who was chased by the murderers may have got up the
ghost, in order to shift the odium of tale-bearing to other shoulders.&nbsp;
The fact of being mixed up in the affair lends some support to the story
here related.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here follows my friend&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s narrative, the name
of the witness being suppressed.</p>
<h3>CONCERNING THE MURDER OF SERGEANT DAVIES</h3>
<p>There is at present living in the neighbourhood of --- an old lady,
about seventy years of age.&nbsp; Her maiden name is ---, <a name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140">{140}</a>
and she is a native of Braemar, but left that district when about twenty
years old, and has never been back to it even for a visit.&nbsp; On
being asked whether she had ever heard the story of Sergeant Davies,
she at first persisted in denying all knowledge of it.&nbsp; The ordinary
version was then related to her, and she listened quietly until it was
finished, when she broke out with:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the way of it at all, for the men <i>were</i>
seen, and it was a forbear of my own that saw them.&nbsp; He had gone
out to try to get a stag, and had his gun and a deer-hound with him.&nbsp;
He saw the men on the hill doing something, and thinking they had got
a deer, he went towards them.&nbsp; When he got near them, the hound
began to run on in front of him, and at that minute <i>he saw what it
was they had</i>.&nbsp; He called to the dog, and turned to run away,
but saw at once that he had made a mistake, for he had called their
attention to himself, and a shot was fired after him, which wounded
the dog.&nbsp; He then ran home as fast as he could, never looking behind
him, and did not know how far the men followed him.&nbsp; Some time
afterwards the dog came home, and he went to see whether it was much
hurt, whereupon it flew at him, and had to be killed.&nbsp; They thought
that it was trying to revenge itself on him for having left it behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point the old lady became conscious that she was telling
the story, and no more could be got out of her.&nbsp; The name of the
lady who keeps a secret of 145 years&rsquo; standing, is the name of
a witness in the trial.&nbsp; The whole affair is thoroughly characteristic
of the Highlanders and of Scottish jurisprudence after Culloden, while
the verdict of &ldquo;Not Guilty&rdquo; (when &ldquo;Not Proven&rdquo;
would have been stretching a point) is evidence to the &ldquo;common-sense&rdquo;
of the eighteenth century. <a name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141">{141}</a></p>
<p>There are other cases, in Webster, Aubrey and Glanvil of ghosts who
tried more successfully to bring their murderers to justice.&nbsp; But
the reports of the trials do not exist, or cannot be found, and Webster
lost a letter which he once possessed, which would have been proof that
ghostly evidence was given and was received at a trial in Durham (1631
or 1632).&nbsp; Reports of old men present were collected for Glanvil,
but are entirely too vague.</p>
<p>The case of <i>Fisher&rsquo;s Ghost</i>, which led to evidence being
given as to a murder in New South Wales, cannot be wholly omitted.&nbsp;
Fisher was a convict settler, a man of some wealth.&nbsp; He disappeared
from his station, and his manager (also a convict) declared that he
had returned to England.&nbsp; Later, a man returning from market saw
Fisher sitting on a rail; at his approach Fisher vanished.&nbsp; Black
trackers were laid on, found human blood on the rail, and finally discovered
Fisher&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; The manager was tried, was condemned, acknowledged
his guilt and was hanged.</p>
<p>The story is told in <i>Household Words</i>, where Sir Frederick
Forbes is said to have acted as judge.&nbsp; No date is given.&nbsp;
In <i>Botany Bay</i>, <a name="citation142"></a><a href="#footnote142">{142}</a>
the legend is narrated by Mr. John Lang, who was in Sydney in 1842.&nbsp;
He gives no date of the occurrence, and clearly embellishes the tale.&nbsp;
In 1835, however, the story is told by Mr. Montgomery Martin in volume
iv. of his <i>History of the British Colonies</i>.&nbsp; He gives the
story as a proof of the acuteness of black trackers.&nbsp; Beyond saying
that he himself was in the colony when the events and the trial occurred,
he gives no date.&nbsp; I have conscientiously investigated the facts,
by aid of the Sydney newspapers, and the notes of the judge, Sir Frederick
Forbes.&nbsp; Fisher disappeared at the end of June, 1826, from Campbeltown.&nbsp;
Suspicion fell on his manager, Worral.&nbsp; A reward was offered late
in September.&nbsp; Late in October the constable&rsquo;s attention
was drawn to blood-stains on a rail.&nbsp; Starting thence, the black
trackers found Fisher&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Worral was condemned and hanged,
after confession, in February, 1827.&nbsp; Not a word is said about
<i>why</i> the constable went to, and examined, the rail.&nbsp; But
Mr. Rusden, author of a <i>History of Australia</i>, knew the medical
attendant D. Farley (who saw Fisher&rsquo;s ghost, and pointed out the
bloody rail), and often discussed it with Farley.&nbsp; Mr. Souttar,
in a work on Colonial traditions, proves the point that Farley told
his ghost story <i>before</i> the body of Fisher was found.&nbsp; But,
for fear of prejudicing the jury, the ghost was kept out of the trial,
exactly as in the following case.</p>
<h3>THE GARDENER&rsquo;S GHOST</h3>
<p>Perhaps the latest ghost in a court of justice (except in cases about
the letting of haunted houses) &ldquo;appeared&rdquo; at the Aylesbury
Petty Session on 22nd August, 1829.&nbsp; On 25th October, 1828, William
Edden, a market gardener, was found dead, with his ribs broken, in the
road between Aylesbury and Thame.&nbsp; One Sewell, in August, 1829,
accused a man named Tyler, and both were examined at the Aylesbury Petty
Sessions.&nbsp; Mrs. Edden gave evidence that she sent five or six times
for Tyler &ldquo;to come and see the corpse. . . .&nbsp; I had some
particular reasons for sending for him which I never did divulge. .
. .&nbsp; I will tell you my reasons, gentlemen, if you ask me, in the
face of Tyler, even if my life should be in danger for it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The reasons were that on the night of her husband&rsquo;s murder, &ldquo;something
rushed over me, and I thought my husband came by me.&nbsp; I looked
up, and I thought I heard the voice of my husband come from near my
mahogany table. . . .&nbsp; I thought I saw my husband&rsquo;s apparition,
and the man that had done it, and that man was Tyler. . . .&nbsp; I
ran out and said, &lsquo;O dear God! my husband is murdered, and his
ribs are broken&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lord Nugent</i>&mdash;&ldquo;What made you think your husband&rsquo;s
ribs were broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He held up his hands like this, and I saw a hammer, or something
like a hammer, and it came into my mind that his ribs were broken.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sewell stated that the murder was accomplished by means of a hammer.</p>
<p>The prisoners were discharged on 13th September.&nbsp; On 5th March,
1830, they were tried at the Buckingham Lent Assizes, were found guilty
and were hanged, protesting their innocence, on 8th March, 1830.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the report of Mrs. Edden&rsquo;s evidence (at the Assizes)
no mention is made of the vision.&rdquo; <a name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144">{144}</a></p>
<p>Here end our ghosts in courts of justice; the following ghost gave
evidence of a murder, or rather, confessed to one, but was beyond the
reach of human laws.</p>
<p>This tale of 1730 is still current in Highland tradition.&nbsp; It
has, however, been improved and made infinitely more picturesque by
several generations of narrators.&nbsp; As we try to be faithful to
the best sources, the contemporary manuscript version is here reprinted
from <i>The Scottish Standard-Bearer</i>, an organ of the Scotch Episcopalians
(October and November, 1894).</p>
<h3>THE DOG O&rsquo; MAUSE</h3>
<p>Account of an apparition that appeared to William Soutar, <a name="citation145a"></a><a href="#footnote145a">{145a}</a>
in the Mause, 1730.</p>
<p>[This is a copy from that in the handwriting of Bishop Rattray, preserved
at Craighall, and which was found at Meikleour a few years ago, to the
proprietor of which, Mr. Mercer, it was probably sent by the Bishop.&mdash;W.
W. H., 3rd August, 1846.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent you an account of an apparition as remarkable,
perhaps, as anything you ever heard of, and which, considered in all
its circumstances, leaves, I think, no ground of doubt to any man of
common-sense.&nbsp; The person to whom it appeared is one William Soutar,
a tenant of Balgowan&rsquo;s, who lives in Middle Mause, within about
half a mile from this place on the other side of the river, and in view
from our windows of Craighall House.&nbsp; He is about thirty-seven
years of age, as he says, and has a wife and bairns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following is an account from his own mouth; and because
there are some circumstances fit to be taken in as you go along, I have
given them with reference at the end, <a name="citation145b"></a><a href="#footnote145b">{145b}</a>
that I may not interrupt the sense of the account, or add anything to
it.&nbsp; Therefore, it begins:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the month of December in the year 1728, about sky-setting,
I and my servant, with several others living in the town (farm-steading)
heard a scratching (screeching, crying), and I followed the noise, with
my servant, a little way from the town (farm-steading throughout).&nbsp;
We both thought we saw what had the appearance to be a fox, and hounded
the dogs at it, but they would not pursue it. <a name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a">{146a}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;About a month after, as I was coming from Blair <a name="citation146b"></a><a href="#footnote146b">{146b}</a>
alone, about the same time of the night, a big dog appeared to me, of
a dark greyish colour, between the Hilltown and Knockhead <a name="citation146c"></a><a href="#footnote146c">{146c}</a>
of Mause, on a lea rig a little below the road, and in passing by it
touched me sonsily (firmly) on the thigh at my haunch-bane (hip-bone),
upon which I pulled my staff from under my arm and let a stroke at it;
and I had a notion at the time that I hit it, and my haunch was painful
all that night.&nbsp; However, I had no great thought of its being anything
particular or extraordinary, but that it might be a mad dog wandering.&nbsp;
About a year after that, to the best of my memory, in December month,
about the same time of the night and in the same place, when I was alone,
it appeared to me again as before, and passed by me at some distance;
and then I began to think it might be something more than ordinary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the month of December, 1730, as I was coming from
Perth, from the Claith (cloth) Market a little before sky-setting, it
appeared to me again, being alone, at the same place, and passed by
me just as before.&nbsp; I had some suspicion of it then likewise, but
I began to think that a neighbour of mine in the Hilltown having an
ox lately dead, it might be a dog that had been at the carrion, by which
I endeavoured to put the suspicion out of my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On the second Monday of December, 1730, as I was coming
from Woodhead, a town (farm) in the ground of Drumlochy, it appeared
to me again in the same place just about sky-setting; and after it had
passed me as it was going out of my sight, it spoke with a low voice
so that I distinctly heard it, these words, &ldquo;Within eight or ten
days do or die,&rdquo; and it thereupon disappeared.&nbsp; No more passed
at that time.&nbsp; On the morrow I went to my brother, who dwells in
the Nether Aird of Drumlochy, and told him of the last and of all the
former appearances, which was the first time I ever spoke of it to anybody.&nbsp;
He and I went to see a sister of ours at Glenballow, who was dying,
but she was dead before we came.&nbsp; As we were returning home, I
desired my brother, whose name is James Soutar, to go forward with me
till we should be passed the place where it used to appear to me; and
just as we had come to it, about ten o&rsquo;clock at night, it appeared
to me again just as formerly; and as it was passing over some ice I
pointed to it with my finger and asked my brother if he saw it, but
he said he did not, nor did his servant, who was with us.&nbsp; It spoke
nothing at that time, but just disappeared as it passed the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On the Saturday after, as I was at my own sheep-cots
putting in my sheep, it appeared to me again just after daylight, betwixt
day and skylight, and upon saying these words, &ldquo;Come to the spot
of ground within half an hour,&rdquo; it just disappeared; whereupon
I came home to my own house, and took up a staff and also a sword off
the head of the bed, and went straight to the place where it used formerly
to appear to me; and after I had been there some minutes and had drawn
a circle about me with my staff, it appeared to me.&nbsp; And I spoke
to it saying, &ldquo;In the name of God and Jesus Christ, what are you
that troubles me?&rdquo; and it answered me, &ldquo;I am David Soutar,
George Soutar&rsquo;s brother. <a name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a">{148a}</a>&nbsp;
I killed a man more than five-and-thirty years ago, when you was new
born, at a bush be-east the road, as you go into the Isle.&rdquo; <a name="citation148b"></a><a href="#footnote148b">{148b}</a>&nbsp;
And as I was going away, I stood again and said, &ldquo;David Soutar
was a man, and you appear like a dog,&rdquo; whereupon it spoke to me
again, saying, &ldquo;I killed him with a dog, and therefore I am made
to speak out of the mouth of a dog, and tell you you must go and bury
these bones&rdquo;.&nbsp; Upon this I went straight to my brother to
his house, and told him what had happened to me.&nbsp; My brother having
told the minister of Blair, he and I came to the minister on Monday
thereafter, as he was examining in a neighbour&rsquo;s house in the
same town where I live.&nbsp; And the minister, with my brother and
me and two or three more, went to the place where the apparition said
the bones were buried, when Rychalzie met us accidentally; and the minister
told Rychalzie the story in the presence of all that were there assembled,
and desired the liberty from him to break up the ground to search for
the bones.&nbsp; Rychalzie made some scruples to allow us to break up
the ground, but said he would go along with us to Glasclune <a name="citation149a"></a><a href="#footnote149a">{149a}</a>;
and if he advised, he would allow search to be made.&nbsp; Accordingly
he went straight along with my brother and me and James Chalmers, a
neighbour who lives in the Hilltown of Mause, to Glasclune, and told
Glasclune the story as above narrated; and he advised Rychalzie to allow
the search to be made, whereupon he gave his consent to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The day after, being Friday, we convened about thirty
or forty men and went to the Isle, and broke up the ground in many places,
searching for the bones, but we found nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On Wednesday the 23rd December, about twelve o&rsquo;clock,
when I was in my bed, I heard a voice but saw nothing; the voice said,
&ldquo;Come away&rdquo;. <a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b">{149b}</a>
Upon this I rose out of my bed, cast on my coat and went to the door,
but did not see it.&nbsp; And I said, &ldquo;In the name of God, what
do you demand of me now?&rdquo;&nbsp; It answered, &ldquo;Go, take up
these bones&rdquo;.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;How shall I get these bones?&rdquo;&nbsp;
It answered again, &ldquo;At the side of a withered bush, <a name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150">{150}</a>
and there are but seven or eight of them remaining&rdquo;.&nbsp; I asked,
&ldquo;Was there any more guilty of that action but you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
It answered, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.&nbsp; I asked again, &ldquo;What is the
reason you trouble me?&rdquo;&nbsp; It answered, &ldquo;Because you
are the youngest&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then said I to it, &ldquo;Depart from
me, and give me a sign that I may know the particular spot, and give
me time&rdquo;.&nbsp; [Here there is written on the margin in a different
hand, &ldquo;You will find the bones at the side of a withered bush.&nbsp;
There are but eight of them, and for a sign you will find the print
of a cross impressed on the ground.&rdquo;]&nbsp; On the morrow, being
Thursday, I went alone to the Isle to see if I could find any sign,
and immediately I saw both the bush, which was a small bush, the greatest
stick in it being about the thickness of a staff, and it was withered
about half-way down; and also the sign, which was about a foot from
the bush.&nbsp; The sign was an exact cross, thus X; each of the two
lines was about a foot and a half in length and near three inches broad,
and more than an inch deeper than the rest of the ground, as if it had
been pressed down, for the ground was not cut.&nbsp; On the morrow,
being Friday, I went and told my brother of the voice that had spoken
to me, and that I had gone and seen the bush which it directed me to
and the above-mentioned sign at it.&nbsp; The next day, being Saturday,
my brother and I went, together with seven or eight men with us, to
the Isle.&nbsp; About sun-rising we all saw the bush and the sign at
it; and upon breaking up the ground just at the bush, we found the bones,
<i>viz</i>., the chaft-teeth (jaw-teeth-molars) in it, one of the thigh
bones, one of the shoulder blades, and a small bone which we supposed
to be a collar bone, which was more consumed than any of the rest, and
two other small bones, which we thought to be bones of the sword-arm.&nbsp;
By the time we had digged up those bones, there convened about forty
men who also saw them.&nbsp; The minister and Rychalzie came to the
place and saw them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We immediately sent to the other side of the water,
to Claywhat, <a name="citation151"></a><a href="#footnote151">{151}</a>
to a wright that was cutting timber there, whom Claywhat brought over
with him, who immediately made a coffin for the bones, and my wife brought
linen to wrap them in, and I wrapped the bones in the linen myself and
put them in the coffin before all these people, and sent for the mort-cloth
and buried them in the churchyard of Blair that evening.&nbsp; There
were near an hundred persons at the burial, and it was a little after
sunset when they were buried.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This above account I have written down as dictated to me by
William Soutar in the presence of Robert Graham, brother to the Laird
of Balgowan, and of my two sons, James and John Rattray, at Craighall,
30th December, 1730.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We at Craighall heard nothing of this history till after the
search was over, but it was told us on the morrow by some of the servants
who had been with the rest at the search; and on Saturday Glasclune&rsquo;s
son came over to Craighall and told us that William Soutar had given
a very distinct account of it to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day, the 1st of December, this David
Soutar (the ghost) listed himself a soldier, being very soon after the
time the apparition said the murder was committed, and William Soutar
declares he had no remembrance of him till that apparition named him
as brother to George Soutar; then, he said, he began to recollect that
when he was about ten years of age he had seen him once at his father&rsquo;s
in a soldier&rsquo;s habit, after which he went abroad and was never
more heard of; neither did William ever before hear of his having listed
as a soldier, neither did William ever before hear of his having killed
a man, nor, indeed, was there ever anything heard of it in the country,
and it is not yet known who the person was that was killed, and whose
bones are now found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son John and I went within a few days after to visit Glasclune,
and had the account from him as William had told him over.&nbsp; From
thence we went to Middle Mause to hear it from himself; but he being
from home, his father, who also lives in that town, gave us the same
account of it which Glasclune had done, and the poor man could not refrain
from shedding tears as he told it, as Glasclune told us his son was
under very great concern when he spoke of it to him.&nbsp; We all thought
this a very odd story, and were under suspense about it because the
bones had not been found upon the search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Another account that also seems to have been written by the
bishop mentions that the murderer on committing the deed went home,
and on looking in at the window he saw William Soutar lying in a cradle&mdash;hence
it was the ghaist always came to him, and not to any of the other relations.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hay Newton, of Newton Hall, a man of great antiquarian tastes
in the last generation, wrote the following notes on the matter:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Widow M&rsquo;Laren, aged seventy-nine, a native of Braemar,
but who has resided on the Craighall estate for sixty years, says that
the tradition is that the man was murdered for his money; that he was
a Highland drover on his return journey from the south; that he arrived
late at night at the Mains of Mause and wished to get to Rychalzie;
that he stayed at the Mains of Mause all night, but left it early next
morning, when David Soutar with his dog accompanied him to show him
the road; but that with the assistance of the dog he murdered the drover
and took his money at the place mentioned; that there was a tailor at
work in his father&rsquo;s house that morning when he returned after
committing the murder (according to the custom at that date by which
tailors went out to make up customers&rsquo; own cloth at their own
houses), and that his mother being surprised at his strange appearance,
asked him what he had been about, to which inquiry he made no reply;
that he did not remain long in the country afterwards, but went to England
and never returned.&nbsp; The last time he was seen he went down by
the Brae of Cockridge.&nbsp; A man of the name of Irons, a fisherman
in Blairgowrie, says that his father, who died a very old man some years
ago, was present at the getting of the bones.&nbsp; Mr. Small, Finzyhan,
when bringing his daughter home from school in Edinburgh, saw a coffin
at the door of a public house near Rychalzie where he generally stopped,
but he did not go in as usual, thinking that there was a death in the
family.&nbsp; The innkeeper came out and asked him why he was passing
the door, and told him the coffin contained the bones of the murdered
man which had been collected, upon which he went into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Soutars disliked much to be questioned on the subject
of the Dog of Mause.&nbsp; Thomas Soutar, who was tenant in Easter Mause,
formerly named Knowhead of Mause, and died last year upwards of eighty
years of age, said that the Soutars came originally from Annandale,
and that their name was Johnston; that there were three brothers who
fled from that part of the country on account of their having killed
a man; that they came by Soutar&rsquo;s Hill, and having asked the name
of the hill, were told &lsquo;Soutar,&rsquo; upon which they said, &lsquo;Soutar
be it then,&rsquo; and took that name.&nbsp; One of the brothers went
south and the others came north.&rdquo; <a name="citation155a"></a><a href="#footnote155a">{155a}</a></p>
<p>The appearance of human ghosts in the form of beasts is common enough;
in Shropshire they usually &ldquo;come&rdquo; as bulls.&nbsp; (See Miss
Burne&rsquo;s <i>Shropshire Folklore</i>.)&nbsp; They do not usually
speak, like the Dog o&rsquo; Mause.&nbsp; M. d&rsquo;Assier, a French
Darwinian, explains that ghosts revert &ldquo;atavistically&rdquo; to
lower forms of animal life! <a name="citation155b"></a><a href="#footnote155b">{155b}</a></p>
<p>We now, in accordance with a promise already made, give an example
of the ghosts of beasts!&nbsp; Here an explanation by the theory that
the consciousness of the beast survives death and affects with a hallucination
the minds of living men and animals, will hardly pass current.&nbsp;
But if such cases were as common and told on evidence as respectable
as that which vouches for appearances of the dead, believers in these
would either have to shift their ground, or to grant that</p>
<blockquote><p>Admitted to that equal sky,<br />
Our faithful dog may bear us company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We omit such things as the dripping death wraith of a drowned cat
who appeared to a lady, or the illused monkey who died in a Chinese
house, after which he haunted it by rapping, secreting objects, and,
in short, in the usual way. <a name="citation155c"></a><a href="#footnote155c">{155c}</a>&nbsp;

<h3>PETER&rsquo;S GHOST</h3>
<p>A naval officer visited a friend in the country.&nbsp; Several men
were sitting round the smoking-room fire when he arrived, and a fox-terrier
was with them.&nbsp; Presently the heavy, shambling footsteps of an
old dog, and the metallic shaking sound of his collar, were heard coming
up stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s old Peter!&rdquo; said his visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Peter&rsquo;s dead</i>!&rdquo; whispered his owner.</p>
<p>The sounds passed through the closed door, heard by all; they pattered
into the room; the fox-terrier bristled up, growled, and pursued a viewless
object across the carpet; from the hearth-rug sounded a shake, a jingle
of a collar and the settling weight of a body collapsing into repose.
<a name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156">{156}</a></p>
<p>This pleasing anecdote rests on what is called <i>nautical evidence</i>,
which, for reasons inexplicable to me, was (in these matters) distrusted
by Sir Walter Scott.</p>

Ghost.&nbsp; Sources of Evidence.&nbsp; The Family Version.&nbsp; A
New Old-Fashioned Ghost.&nbsp; Half-past One o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Put
out the Light</i>!</p>
<p>The ghost in the following famous tale had a purpose.&nbsp; He was
a Highland ghost, a Campbell, and desired vengeance on a Macniven, who
murdered him.&nbsp; The ghost, practically, &ldquo;cried <i>Cruachan</i>,&rdquo;
and tried to rouse the clan.&nbsp; Failing in this, owing to Inverawe&rsquo;s
loyalty to his oath, the ghost uttered a prophecy.</p>
<p>The tale is given in the words of Miss Elspeth Campbell, who collected
it at Inverawe from a Highland narrator.&nbsp; She adds a curious supplementary
tradition in the Argyle family.</p>
<h3>TICONDEROGA</h3>
<p>It was one evening in the summer of the year 1755 that Campbell of
Inverawe <a name="citation157"></a><a href="#footnote157">{157}</a>
was on Cruachan hill side.&nbsp; He was startled by seeing a man coming
towards him at full speed; a man ragged, bleeding, and evidently suffering
agonies of terror.&nbsp; &ldquo;The avengers of blood are on my track,
Oh, save me!&rdquo; the poor wretch managed to gasp out.&nbsp; Inverawe,
filled with pity for the miserable man, swore &ldquo;By the word of
an Inverawe which never failed friend or foe yet&rdquo; to save him.</p>
<p>Inverawe then led the stranger to the secret cave on Cruachan hill
side.</p>
<p>None knew of this cave but the laird of Inverawe himself, as the
secret was most carefully kept and had been handed down from father
to son for many generations.&nbsp; The entrance was small, and no one
passing would for an instant suspect it to be other than a tod&rsquo;s
hole, <a name="citation158a"></a><a href="#footnote158a">{158a}</a>
but within were fair-sized rooms, one containing a well of the purest
spring water.&nbsp; It is said that Wallace and Bruce had made use of
this cave in earlier days.</p>
<p>Here Inverawe left his guest.&nbsp; The man was so overcome by terror
that he clung on to Inverawe&rsquo;s plaid, <a name="citation158b"></a><a href="#footnote158b">{158b}</a>
imploring him not to leave him alone.&nbsp; Inverawe was filled with
disgust at this cowardly conduct, and already almost repented having
plighted his word to save such a worthless creature.</p>
<p>On Inverawe&rsquo;s return home he found a man in a state of great
excitement waiting to see him.&nbsp; This man informed him of the murder
of his (Inverawe&rsquo;s) foster-brother by one Macniven.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
have,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tracked the murderer to within a short
distance of this place, and I am here to warn you in case he should
seek your protection.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inverawe turned pale and remained
silent, not knowing what answer to give.&nbsp; The man, knowing the
love that subsisted between the foster-brothers, thought this silence
arose from grief alone, and left the house to pursue the search for
Macniven further.</p>
<p>The compassion Inverawe felt for the trembling man he had left in
the cave turned to hate when he thought of his beloved foster-brother
murdered; but as he had plighted his word to save him, save him he must
and would.&nbsp; As soon, therefore, as night fell he went to the cave
with food, and promised to return with more the next day.</p>
<p>Thoroughly worn out, as soon as he reached home he retired to rest,
but sleep he could not.&nbsp; So taking up a book he began to read.&nbsp;
A shadow fell across the page.&nbsp; He looked up and saw his foster-brother
standing by the bedside.&nbsp; But, oh, how changed!&nbsp; His fair
hair clotted with blood; his face pale and drawn, and his garments all
gory.&nbsp; He uttered the following words: &ldquo;Inverawe, shield
not the murderer; blood must flow for blood,&rdquo; and then faded away
out of sight.</p>
<p>In spite of the spirit&rsquo;s commands, Inverawe remained true to
his promise, and returned next day to Macniven with fresh provisions.&nbsp;
That night his foster-brother again appeared to him uttering the same
warning: &ldquo;Inverawe, Inverawe, shield not the murderer; blood must
flow for blood&rdquo;.&nbsp; At daybreak Inverawe hurried off to the
cave, and said to Macniven: &ldquo;I can shield you no longer; you must
escape as best you can&rdquo;.&nbsp; Inverawe now hoped to receive no
further visit from the vengeful spirit.&nbsp; In this he was disappointed,
for at the usual hour the ghost appeared, and in anger said, &ldquo;I
have warned you once, I have warned you twice; it is too late now.&nbsp;
We shall meet again at TICONDEROGA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inverawe rose before dawn and went straight to the cave.&nbsp; Macniven
was gone!</p>
<p>Inverawe saw no more of the ghost, but the adventure left him a gloomy,
melancholy man.&nbsp; Many a time he would wander on Cruachan hill side,
brooding over his vision, and people passing him would see the far-away
look in his eyes, and would say one to the other: &ldquo;The puir laird,
he is aye thinking on him that is gone&rdquo;.&nbsp; Only his dearest
friends knew the cause of his melancholy.</p>
<p>In 1756 the war between the English and French in America broke out.&nbsp;
The 42nd regiment embarked, and landed at New York in June of that year.&nbsp;
Campbell of Inverawe was a major in the regiment.&nbsp; The lieut.-colonel
was Francis Grant.&nbsp; From New York the 42nd proceeded to Albany,
where the regiment remained inactive till the spring of 1757.&nbsp;
One evening when the 42nd were still quartered at this place, Inverawe
asked the colonel &ldquo;if he had ever heard of a place called Ticonderoga&rdquo;.
<a name="citation160"></a><a href="#footnote160">{160}</a>&nbsp; Colonel
Grant replied he had never heard the name before.&nbsp; Inverawe then
told his story.&nbsp; Most of the officers were present at the time;
some were impressed, others were inclined to look upon the whole thing
as a joke, but seeing how very much disturbed Inverawe was about it
all, even the most unbelieving refrained from bantering him.</p>
<p>In 1758 an expedition was to be directed against Ticonderoga, on
Lake George, a fort erected by the French.&nbsp; The Highlanders were
to form part of this expedition.&nbsp; The force was under Major-General
Abercromby.</p>
<p>Ticonderoga was called by the French St. Louis [really &ldquo;Fort
Carillon&rdquo;], and Inverawe knew it by no other name.&nbsp; One of
the officers told Colonel Grant that the Indian name of the place was
Ticonderoga.&nbsp; Grant, remembering Campbell&rsquo;s story, said:
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let Campbell know this, or harm
will come of it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The troops embarked on Lake George and landed without opposition
near the extremity of the lake early in July.&nbsp; They marched from
there, through woods, upon Ticonderoga, having had one successful skirmish
with the enemy, driving them back with considerable loss.&nbsp; Lord
Howe was killed in this engagement.</p>
<p>On the 10th of July the assault was directed to be commenced by the
picquets. <a name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162">{162}</a>&nbsp;
The Grenadiers were to follow, supported by the battalions and reserves.&nbsp;
The Highlanders and 55th regiment formed the reserve.</p>
<p>In vain the troops attempted to force their way through the abbatis,
they themselves being exposed to a heavy artillery and musket fire from
an enemy well under cover.&nbsp; The Highlanders could no longer be
restrained, and rushed forward from the reserve, cutting and carving
their way through trees and other obstacles with their claymores.&nbsp;
The deadly fire still continued from the fort.&nbsp; As no ladders had
been provided for scaling the breastwork, the soldiers climbed on to
one another&rsquo;s shoulders, and made holes for their feet in the
face of the work with their swords and bayonets, but as soon as a man
reached the top he was thrown down.&nbsp; Captain John Campbell and
a few men succeeded at last in forcing their way over the breastworks,
but were immediately cut down.</p>
<p>After a long and desperate struggle, lasting in fact nearly four
hours, General Abercromby gave orders for a retreat.&nbsp; The troops
could hardly be prevailed upon to retire, and it was not till the order
had been given for the third time that the Highlanders withdrew from
the hopeless encounter.&nbsp; The loss sustained by the regiment was
as follows: eight officers, nine sergeants and 297 men killed; seventeen
officers, ten sergeants and 306 men wounded.</p>
<p>Inverawe, after having fought with the greatest courage, received
at length his death wound.&nbsp; Colonel Grant hastened to the dying
man&rsquo;s side, who looked reproachfully at him, and said: &ldquo;You
deceived me; this is Ticonderoga, for I have seen him&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Inverawe never spoke again.&nbsp; Inverawe&rsquo;s son, an officer in
the same regiment, also lost his life at Ticonderoga.</p>
<p>On the very day that these events were happening in far-away America,
two ladies, Miss Campbell of Ederein and her sister, were walking from
Kilmalieu to Inveraray, and had reached the then new bridge over the
Aray.&nbsp; One of them happened to look up at the sky.&nbsp; She gave
a call to her sister to look also.&nbsp; They both of them saw in the
sky what looked like a siege going on.&nbsp; They saw the different
regiments with their colours, and recognised many of their friends among
the Highlanders.&nbsp; They saw Inverawe and his son fall, and other
men whom they knew.&nbsp; When they reached Inveraray they told all
their friends of the vision they had just seen.&nbsp; They also took
down the names of those they had seen fall, and the time and date of
the occurrence.&nbsp; The well-known Danish physician, Sir William Hart,
was, together with an Englishman and a servant, walking round the Castle
of Inveraray.&nbsp; These men saw the same phenomena, and confirmed
the statements made by the two ladies.&nbsp; Weeks after the gazette
corroborated their statements in its account of the attempt made on
Ticonderoga.&nbsp; Every detail was correct in the vision, down to the
actual number of the killed and wounded.</p>
<p>But there was sorrow throughout Argyll long before the gazette appeared.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>We now give the best attainable version of a yet more famous legend,
&ldquo;The Tyrone Ghost&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The literary history of &ldquo;The Tyrone Ghost&rdquo; is curious.&nbsp;
In 1802 Scott used the tale as the foundation of his ballad, <i>The
Eve of St. John</i>, and referred to the tradition of a noble Irish
family in a note.&nbsp; In 1858 the subject was discussed in <i>Notes
and Queries</i>.&nbsp; A reference was given to Lyon&rsquo;s privately
printed <i>Grand Juries of Westmeath from</i> 1751.&nbsp; The version
from that rare work, a version dated &ldquo;Dublin, August, 1802,&rdquo;
was published in <i>Notes and Queries</i> of 24th July, 1858.&nbsp;
In December, 1896, a member of the Beresford family published in <i>The
Nines</i> (a journal of the Wiltshire regiment), the account which follows,
derived from a MS. at Curraghmore, written by Lady Betty Cobbe, granddaughter
of the ghost-seer, Lady Beresford.&nbsp; The writer in <i>The Nines</i>
remembers Lady Betty.&nbsp; The account of 1802 is clearly derived from
the Curraghmore MS., but omits dates; calls Sir Tristram Beresford &ldquo;Sir
Marcus &ldquo;; leaves out the visit to Gill Hall, where the ghost appeared,
and substitutes blanks for the names of persons concerned.&nbsp; Otherwise
the differences in the two versions are mainly verbal.</p>
<h3>THE BERESFORD GHOST</h3>
<p>&ldquo;There is at Curraghmore, the seat of Lord Waterford, in Ireland,
a manuscript account of the tale, such as it was originally received
and implicitly believed in by the children and grandchildren of the
lady to whom Lord Tyrone is supposed to have made the supernatural appearance
after death.&nbsp; The account was written by Lady Betty Cobbe, the
youngest daughter of Marcus, Earl of Tyrone, and granddaughter of Nicola
S., Lady Beresford.&nbsp; She lived to a good old age, in full use of
all her faculties, both of body and mind.&nbsp; I can myself remember
her, for when a boy I passed through Bath on a journey with my mother,
and we went to her house there, and had luncheon.&nbsp; She appeared
to my juvenile imagination a very appropriate person to revise and transmit
such a tale, and fully adapted to do ample justice to her subject-matter.&nbsp;
It never has been doubted in the family that she received the full particulars
in early life, and that she heard the circumstances, such as they were
believed to have occurred, from the nearest relatives of the two persons,
the supposed actors in this mysterious interview, <i>viz</i>., from
her own father, Lord Tyrone, who died in 1763, and from her aunt, Lady
Riverston, who died in 1763 also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two were both with their mother, Lady Beresford, on
the day of her decease, and they, without assistance or witness, took
off from their parent&rsquo;s wrist the black bandage which she had
always worn on all occasions and times, even at Court, as some very
old persons who lived well into the eighteenth century testified, having
received their information from eyewitnesses of the fact.&nbsp; There
was an oil painting of this lady in Tyrone House, Dublin, representing
her with a black ribbon bound round her wrist.&nbsp; This portrait disappeared
in an unaccountable manner.&nbsp; It used to hang in one of the drawing-rooms
in that mansion, with other family pictures.&nbsp; When Henry, Marquis
of Waterford, sold the old town residence of the family and its grounds
to the Government as the site of the Education Board, he directed Mr.
Watkins, a dealer in pictures, and a man of considerable knowledge in
works of art and vertu, to collect the pictures, etc., etc., which were
best adapted for removal to Curraghmore.&nbsp; Mr. Watkins especially
picked out this portrait, not only as a good work of art, but as one
which, from its associations, deserved particular care and notice.&nbsp;
When, however, the lot arrived at Curraghmore and was unpacked, no such
picture was found; and though Mr. Watkins took great pains and exerted
himself to the utmost to trace what had become of it, to this day (nearly
forty years), not a hint of its existence has been received or heard
of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John le Poer, Lord Decies, was the eldest son of Richard,
Earl of Tyrone, and of Lady Dorothy Annesley, daughter of Arthur, Earl
of Anglesey.&nbsp; He was born 1665, succeeded his father 1690, and
died 14th October, 1693.&nbsp; He became Lord Tyrone at his father&rsquo;s
death, and is the &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; of the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicola Sophie Hamilton was the second and youngest daughter
and co-heiress of Hugh, Lord Glenawley, who was also Baron Lunge in
Sweden.&nbsp; Being a zealous Royalist, he had, together with his father,
migrated to that country in 1643, and returned from it at the Restoration.&nbsp;
He was of a good old family, and held considerable landed property in
the county Tyrone, near Ballygawley.&nbsp; He died there in 1679.&nbsp;
His eldest daughter and co-heiress, Arabella Susanna, married, in 1683,
Sir John Macgill, of Gill Hall, in the county Down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicola S. (the second daughter) was born in 1666, and married
Sir Tristram Beresford in 1687.&nbsp; Between that and 1693 two daughters
were born, but no son to inherit the ample landed estates of his father,
who most anxiously wished and hoped for an heir.&nbsp; It was under
these circumstances, and at this period, that the manuscripts state
that Lord Tyrone made his appearance after death; and all the versions
of the story, without variation, attribute the same cause and reason,
<i>viz</i>., a solemn promise mutually interchanged in early life between
John le Poer, then Lord Decies, afterwards Lord Tyrone, and Nicola S.
Hamilton, that whichever of the two died the first, should, if permitted,
appear to the survivor for the object of declaring the approval or rejection
by the Deity of the revealed religion as generally acknowledged: of
which the departed one must be fully cognisant, but of which they both
had in their youth entertained unfortunate doubts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the month of October, 1693, Sir Tristram and Lady Beresford
went on a visit to her sister, Lady Macgill, at Gill Hall, now the seat
of Lord Clanwilliam, whose grandmother was eventually the heiress of
Sir J. Macgill&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; One morning Sir Tristram rose
early, leaving Lady Beresford asleep, and went out for a walk before
breakfast.&nbsp; When his wife joined the table very late, her appearance
and the embarrassment of her manner attracted general attention, especially
that of her husband.&nbsp; He made anxious inquiries as to her health,
and asked her apart what had occurred to her wrist, which was tied up
with black ribbon tightly bound round it.&nbsp; She earnestly entreated
him not to inquire more then, or thereafter, as to the cause of her
wearing or continuing afterwards to wear that ribbon; &lsquo;for,&rsquo;
she added, &lsquo;you will never see me without it&rsquo;.&nbsp; He
replied, &lsquo;Since you urge it so vehemently, I promise you not to
inquire more about it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After completing her hurried breakfast she made anxious inquiries
as to whether the post had yet arrived.&nbsp; It had not yet come in;
and Sir Tristram asked: &lsquo;Why are you so particularly eager about
letters to-day?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Because I expect to hear of Lord
Tyrone&rsquo;s death, which took place on Tuesday.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
remarked Sir Tristram, &lsquo;I never should have put you down for a
superstitious person; but I suppose that some idle dream has disturbed
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shortly after, the servant brought in the letters;
one was sealed with black wax.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is as I expected,&rsquo;
she cries; &lsquo;he is dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; The letter was from Lord
Tyrone&rsquo;s steward to inform them that his master had died in Dublin,
on Tuesday, 14th October, at 4 p.m.&nbsp; Sir Tristram endeavoured to
console her, and begged her to restrain her grief, when she assured
him that she felt relieved and easier now that she knew the actual fact.&nbsp;
She added, &lsquo;I can now give you a most satisfactory piece of intelligence,
<i>viz</i>., that I am with child, and that it will be a boy&rsquo;.&nbsp;
A son was born in the following July.&nbsp; Sir Tristram survived its
birth little more than six years.&nbsp; After his death Lady Beresford
continued to reside with her young family at his place in the county
of Derry, and seldom went from home.&nbsp; She hardly mingled with any
neighbours or friends, excepting with Mr. and Mrs. Jackson, of Coleraine.&nbsp;
He was the principal personage in that town, and was, by his mother,
a near relative of Sir Tristram.&nbsp; His wife was the daughter of
Robert Gorges, LL.D. (a gentleman of good old English family, and possessed
of a considerable estate in the county Meath), by Jane Loftus, daughter
of Sir Adam Loftus, of Rathfarnham, and sister of Lord Lisburn.&nbsp;
They had an only son, Richard Gorges, who was in the army, and became
a general officer very early in life.&nbsp; With the Jacksons Lady Beresford
maintained a constant communication and lived on the most intimate terms,
while she seemed determined to eschew all other society and to remain
in her chosen retirement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the conclusion of three years thus passed, one luckless
day &ldquo;Young Gorges&rdquo; most vehemently professed his passion
for her, and solicited her hand, urging his suit in a most passionate
appeal, which was evidently not displeasing to the fair widow, and which,
unfortunately for her, was successful.&nbsp; They were married in 1704.&nbsp;
One son and two daughters were born to them, when his abandoned and
dissolute conduct forced her to seek and to obtain a separation.&nbsp;
After this had continued for four years, General Gorges pretended extreme
penitence for his past misdeeds, and with the most solemn promises of
amendment induced his wife to live with him again, and she became the
mother of a second son.&nbsp; The day month after her confinement happened
to be her birthday, and having recovered and feeling herself equal to
some exertion, she sent for her son, Sir Marcus Beresford, then twenty
years old, and her married daughter, Lady Riverston.&nbsp; She also
invited Dr. King, the Archbishop of Dublin (who was an intimate friend),
and an old clergyman who had christened her, and who had always kept
up a most kindly intercourse with her during her whole life, to make
up a small party to celebrate the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the early part of it Lady Beresford was engaged in a kindly
conversation with her old friend the clergyman, and in the course of
it said: &lsquo;You know that I am forty-eight this day&rsquo;.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;you are only forty-seven,
for your mother had a dispute with me once on the very subject of your
age, and I in consequence sent and consulted the registry, and can most
confidently assert that you are only forty-seven this day.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You have signed my death-warrant, then,&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;leave
me, I pray, for I have not much longer to live, but have many things
of grave importance to settle before I die.&nbsp; Send my son and my
daughter to me immediately.&rsquo;&nbsp; The clergyman did as he was
bidden.&nbsp; He directed Sir Marcus and his sister to go instantly
to their mother; and he sent to the archbishop and a few other friends
to put them off from joining the birthday party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When her two children repaired to Lady Beresford, she thus
addressed them: &lsquo;I have something of deep importance to communicate
to you, my dear children, before I die.&nbsp; You are no strangers to
the intimacy and the affection which subsisted in early life between
Lord Tyrone and myself.&nbsp; We were educated together when young,
under the same roof, in the pernicious principles of Deism.&nbsp; Our
real friends afterwards took every opportunity to convince us of our
error, but their arguments were insufficient to overpower and uproot
our infidelity, though they had the effect of shaking our confidence
in it, and thus leaving us wavering between the two opinions.&nbsp;
In this perplexing state of doubt we made a solemn promise one to the
other, that whichever died first should, if permitted, appear to the
other for the purpose of declaring what religion was the one acceptable
to the Almighty.&nbsp; One night, years after this interchange of promises,
I was sleeping with your father at Gill Hall, when I suddenly awoke
and discovered Lord Tyrone sitting visibly by the side of the bed.&nbsp;
I screamed out, and vainly endeavoured to rouse Sir Tristram.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Lord Tyrone, why and wherefore
are you here at this time of the night?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you
then forgotten our promise to each other, pledged in early life?&nbsp;
I died on Tuesday, at four o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I have been permitted
thus to appear in order to assure you that the revealed religion is
the true and only one by which we can be saved.&nbsp; I am also suffered
to inform you that you are with child, and will produce a son, who will
marry my heiress; that Sir Tristram will not live long, when you will
marry again, and you will die from the effects of childbirth in your
forty-seventh year.&rdquo;&nbsp; I begged from him some convincing sign
or proof so that when the morning came I might rely upon it, and feel
satisfied that his appearance had been real, and that it was not the
phantom of my imagination.&nbsp; He caused the hangings of the bed to
be drawn in an unusual way and impossible manner through an iron hook.&nbsp;
I still was not satisfied, when he wrote his signature in my pocket-book.&nbsp;
I wanted, however, more substantial proof of his visit, when he laid
his hand, which was cold as marble, on my wrist; the sinews shrunk up,
the nerves withered at the touch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;let no mortal eye, while you live, ever see that wrist,&rdquo;
and vanished.&nbsp; While I was conversing with him my thoughts were
calm, but as soon as he disappeared I felt chilled with horror and dismay,
a cold sweat came over me, and I again endeavoured but vainly to awaken
Sir Tristram; a flood of tears came to my relief, and I fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the morning your father got up without disturbing
me; he had not noticed anything extraordinary about me or the bed-hangings.&nbsp;
When I did arise I found a long broom in the gallery outside the bedroom
door, and with great difficulty I unhooded the curtain, fearing that
the position of it might excite surprise and cause inquiry.&nbsp; I
bound up my wrist with black ribbon before I went down to breakfast,
where the agitation of my mind was too visible not to attract attention.&nbsp;
Sir Tristram made many anxious inquiries as to my health, especially
as to my sprained wrist, as he conceived mine to be.&nbsp; I begged
him to drop all questions as to the bandage, even if I continued to
adopt it for any length of time.&nbsp; He kindly promised me not to
speak of it any more, and he kept his promise faithfully.&nbsp; You,
my son, came into the world as predicted, and your father died six years
after.&nbsp; I then determined to abandon society and its pleasures
and not mingle again with the world, hoping to avoid the dreadful predictions
as to my second marriage; but, alas! in the one family with which I
held constant and friendly intercourse I met the man, whom I did not
regard with perfect indifference.&nbsp; Though I struggled to conquer
by every means the passion, I at length yielded to his solicitations,
and in a fatal moment for my own peace I became his wife.&nbsp; In a
few years his conduct fully justified my demand for a separation, and
I fondly hoped to escape the fatal prophecy.&nbsp; Under the delusion
that I had passed my forty-seventh birthday, I was prevailed upon to
believe in his amendment, and to pardon him.&nbsp; I have, however,
heard from undoubted authority that I am only forty-seven this day,
and I know that I am about to die.&nbsp; I die, however, without the
dread of death, fortified as I am by the sacred precepts of Christianity
and upheld by its promises.&nbsp; When I am gone, I wish that you, my
children, should unbind this black ribbon and alone behold my wrist
before I am consigned to the grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She then requested to be left that she might lie down and
compose herself, and her children quitted the apartment, having desired
her attendant to watch her, and if any change came on to summon them
to her bedside.&nbsp; In an hour the bell rang, and they hastened to
the call, but all was over.&nbsp; The two children having ordered every
one to retire, knelt down by the side of the bed, when Lady Riverston
unbound the black ribbon and found the wrist exactly as Lady Beresford
had described it&mdash;every nerve withered, every sinew shrunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her friend, the Archbishop, had had her buried in the Cathedral
of St. Patrick, in Dublin, in the Earl of Cork&rsquo;s tomb, where she
now lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The writer now professes his disbelief in any spiritual presence,
and explains his theory that Lady Beresford&rsquo;s anxiety about Lord
Tyrone deluded her by a vivid dream, during which she hurt her wrist.</p>
<p>Of all ghost stories the Tyrone, or Beresford Ghost, has most variants.&nbsp;
Following Monsieur Haur&eacute;au, in the <i>Journal des Savants</i>,
I have tracked the tale, the death compact, and the wound inflicted
by the ghost on the hand, or wrist, or brow, of the seer, through Henry
More, and Melanchthon, and a medi&aelig;val sermon by Eudes de Shirton,
to William of Malmesbury, a range of 700 years.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant of
Laggan has a rather recent case, and I have heard of another in the
last ten years!&nbsp; Calmet has a case in 1625, the spectre leaves</p>
<blockquote><p>The sable score of fingers four</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on a board of wood.</p>
<p>Now for a modern instance of a gang of ghosts with a purpose!</p>
<p>When I narrated the story which follows to an eminent moral philosopher,
he remarked, at a given point, &ldquo;Oh, the ghost <i>spoke</i>, did
she?&rdquo; and displayed scepticism.&nbsp; The evidence, however, left
him, as it leaves me, at a standstill, not convinced, but agreeably
perplexed.&nbsp; The ghosts here are truly old-fashioned.</p>
<p>My story is, and must probably remain, entirely devoid of proof,
as far as any kind of ghostly influence is concerned.&nbsp; We find
ghosts appearing, and imposing a certain course of action on a living
witness, for definite purposes of their own.&nbsp; The course of action
prescribed was undeniably pursued, and apparently the purpose of the
ghosts was fulfilled, but what that purpose was their agent declines
to state, and conjecture is hopelessly baffled.</p>
<p>The documents in the affair have been published by the Society for
Psychical Research (<i>Proceedings</i>, vol. xi., p. 547), and are here
used for reference.&nbsp; But I think the matter will be more intelligible
if I narrate it exactly as it came under my own observation.&nbsp; The
names of persons and places are all fictitious, and are the same as
those used in the documents published by the S.P.R.</p>
<h3>HALF-PAST ONE O&rsquo;CLOCK</h3>
<p>In October, 1893, I was staying at a town which we shall call Rapingham.&nbsp;
One night I and some kinsfolk dined with another old friend of all of
us, a Dr. Ferrier.&nbsp; In the course of dinner he asked <i>&agrave;
propos de bottes</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard of the ghost in Blake Street?&rdquo; a sunny,
pleasant street of respectable but uninteresting antiquity in Rapingham.</p>
<p>We had none of us heard of the ghost, and begged the doctor to enlighten
our ignorance.&nbsp; His story ran thus&mdash;I have it in his own writing
as far as its essence goes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;belongs to my friends, the
Applebys, who let it, as they live elsewhere.&nbsp; A quiet couple took
it and lived in it for five years, when the husband died, and the widow
went away.&nbsp; They made no complaint while tenants.&nbsp; The house
stood empty for some time, and all I know personally about the matter
is that I, my wife, and the children were in the dining-room one Sunday
when we heard unusual noises in the drawing-room overhead.&nbsp; We
went through the rooms but could find no cause or explanation of the
disturbance, and thought no more about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six or seven years ago I let the house to a Mr. Buckley,
who is still the tenant.&nbsp; He was unmarried, and his family consisted
of his mother and sisters.&nbsp; They preceded him to put the place
in order, and before his arrival came to me in some irritation complaining
that I had let them <i>a haunted house</i>!&nbsp; They insisted that
there were strange noises, as if heavy weights were being dragged about,
or heavy footsteps pacing in the rooms and on the stairs.&nbsp; I said
that I knew nothing about the matter.&nbsp; The stairs are of stone,
water is only carried up to the first floor, there is an unused system
of hot air pipes. <a name="citation177a"></a><a href="#footnote177a">{177a}</a>&nbsp;
Something went wrong with the water-main in the area once, but the noises
lasted after it was mended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Buckley when he arrived never heard anything unusual.&nbsp;
But one evening as he walked upstairs carrying an ink-bottle, he found
his hand full of some liquid.&nbsp; Thinking that he had spilt the ink,
he went to a window where he found his hand full of water, to account
for which there was no stain on the ceiling, or anything else that he
could discover.&nbsp; On another occasion one of the young ladies was
kneeling by a trunk in an attic, alone, when water was switched over
her face, as if from a wet brush. <a name="citation177b"></a><a href="#footnote177b">{177b}</a>&nbsp;
There was a small pool of water on the floor, and the wall beyond her
was sprinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time went on, and the disturbances were very rare: in fact
ceased for two years till the present week, when Mrs. Claughton, a widow
accompanied by two of her children, came to stay with the Buckleys.
<a name="citation177c"></a><a href="#footnote177c">{177c}</a>&nbsp;
She had heard of the disturbances and the theory of hauntings&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know if these things interested her or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early on Monday, 9th October, Mrs. Claughton came to consult
me.&nbsp; Her story was this: About a quarter past one on Sunday night,
or Monday morning, she was in bed with one of her children, the other
sleeping in the room.&nbsp; She was awakened by footsteps on the stair,
and supposed that a servant was coming to call her to Miss Buckley,
who was ill.&nbsp; The steps stopped at the door, then the noise was
repeated.&nbsp; Mrs. Claughton lit her bedroom candle, opened the door
and listened.&nbsp; There was no one there.&nbsp; The clock on the landing
pointed to twenty minutes past one.&nbsp; Mrs. Claughton went back to
bed, read a book, fell asleep, and woke to find the candle still lit,
but low in the socket.&nbsp; She heard a sigh, and saw a lady, unknown
to her, her head swathed in a soft white shawl, her expression gentle
and refined, her features much emaciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Appearance said, &lsquo;Follow me,&rsquo; and Mrs. Claughton,
taking the bedroom candle, rose and followed out on to the landing,
and so into the adjacent drawing-room.&nbsp; She cannot remember opening
the door, which the housemaid had locked outside, and she owns that
this passage is dreamlike in her memory.&nbsp; Seeing that her candle
was flickering out, she substituted for it a pink one taken from a chiffonier.&nbsp;
The figure walked nearly to the window, turned three-quarters round,
said &lsquo;To-morrow!&rsquo; and was no more seen.&nbsp; Mrs. Claughton
went back to her room, where her eldest child asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is the lady in white?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only me, mother, go to sleep,&rsquo; she thinks she
answered.&nbsp; After lying awake for two hours, with gas burning, she
fell asleep.&nbsp; The pink candle from the drawing-room chiffonier
was in her candlestick in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After hearing the lady&rsquo;s narrative I told her to try
change of air, which she declined as cowardly.&nbsp; So, as she would
stay on at Mr. Buckley&rsquo;s, I suggested that an electric alarm communicating
with Miss Buckley&rsquo;s room should be rigged up, and this was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the doctor paused, and as the events had happened within the
week, we felt that we were at last on the track of a recent ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning, about one, the Buckleys were aroused by a tremendous
peal of the alarm; Mrs. Claughton they found in a faint.&nbsp; Next
morning <a name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179">{179}</a> she
consulted me as to the whereabouts of a certain place, let me call it
&lsquo;Meresby&rsquo;.&nbsp; I suggested the use of a postal directory;
we found Meresby, a place extremely unknown to fame, in an agricultural
district about five hours from London in the opposite direction from
Rapingham.&nbsp; To this place Mrs. Claughton said she must go, in the
interest and by the order of certain ghosts, whom she saw on Monday
night, and whose injunctions she had taken down in a note-book.&nbsp;
She has left Rapingham for London, and there,&rdquo; said the doctor,
&ldquo;my story ends for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We expected it to end for good and all, but in the course of the
week came a communication to the doctor in writing from Mrs. Claughton&rsquo;s
governess.&nbsp; This lady, on Mrs. Claughton&rsquo;s arrival at her
London house (Friday, 13th October), passed a night perturbed by sounds
of weeping, &ldquo;loud moans,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a very odd noise overhead,
like some electric battery gone wrong,&rdquo; in fact, much like the
&ldquo;warning&rdquo; of a jack running down, which Old Jeffrey used
to give at the Wesley&rsquo;s house in Epworth.&nbsp; There were also
heavy footsteps and thuds, as of moving weighty bodies.&nbsp; So far
the governess.</p>
<p>This curious communication I read at Rapingham on Saturday, 14th
October, or Sunday, 15th October.&nbsp; On Monday I went to town.&nbsp;
In the course of the week I received a letter from my kinsman in Rapingham,
saying that Mrs. Claughton had written to Dr. Ferrier, telling him that
she had gone to Meresby on Saturday; had accomplished the bidding of
the ghosts, and had lodged with one Joseph Wright, the parish clerk.&nbsp;
Her duty had been to examine the Meresby parish registers, and to compare
certain entries with information given by the ghosts and written by
her in her note-book.&nbsp; If the entries in the parish register tallied
with her notes, she was to pass the time between one o&rsquo;clock and
half-past one, alone, in Meresby Church, and receive a communication
from the spectres.&nbsp; All this she said that she had done, and in
evidence of her journey enclosed her half ticket to Meresby, which a
dream had warned her would not be taken on her arrival.&nbsp; She also
sent a white rose from a grave to Dr. Ferrier, a gentleman in no sympathy
with the Jacobite cause, which, indeed, has no connection whatever with
the matter in hand.</p>
<p>On hearing of this letter from Mrs. Claughton, I confess that, not
knowing the lady, I remained purely sceptical.&nbsp; The railway company,
however, vouched for the ticket.&nbsp; The rector of Meresby, being
appealed to, knew nothing of the matter.&nbsp; He therefore sent for
his curate and parish clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did a lady pass part of Sunday night in the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk and the curate admitted that this unusual event <i>had</i>
occurred.&nbsp; A lady had arrived from London on Saturday evening;
had lodged with Wright, the parish clerk; had asked for the parish registers;
had compared them with her note-book after morning service on Sunday,
and had begged leave to pass part of the night in the church.&nbsp;
The curate in vain tried to dissuade her, and finally, washing his hands
of it, had left her to Wright the clerk.&nbsp; To him she described
a Mr. George Howard, deceased (one of the ghosts).&nbsp; He recognised
the description, and he accompanied her to the church on a dark night,
starting at one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; She stayed alone, without a light,
in the locked-up church from 1.20 to 1.45, when he let her out.</p>
<p>There now remained no doubt that Mrs. Claughton had really gone to
Meresby, a long and disagreeable journey, and had been locked up in
the church alone at a witching hour.</p>
<p>Beyond this point we have only the statements of Mrs. Claughton,
made to Lord Bute, Mr. Myers and others, and published by the Society
for Psychical Research.&nbsp; She says that after arranging the alarm
bell on Monday night (October 9-10) she fell asleep reading in her dressing-gown,
lying outside her bed.&nbsp; She wakened, and found the lady of the
white shawl bending over her.&nbsp; Mrs. Claughton said: &ldquo;Am I
dreaming, or is it true?&rdquo;&nbsp; The figure gave, as testimony
to character, a piece of information.&nbsp; Next Mrs. Claughton saw
a male ghost, &ldquo;tall, dark, healthy, sixty years old,&rdquo; who
named himself as George Howard, buried in Meresby churchyard, Meresby
being a place of which Mrs. Claughton, like most people, now heard for
the first time.&nbsp; He gave the dates of his marriage and death, which
are correct, and have been seen by Mr. Myers in Mrs. Claughton&rsquo;s
note-book.&nbsp; He bade her verify these dates at Meresby, and wait
at 1.15 in the morning at the grave of Richard Harte (a person, like
all of them, unknown to Mrs. Claughton) at the south-west corner of
the south aisle in Meresby Church.&nbsp; This Mr. Harte died on 15th
May, 1745, and missed many events of interest by doing so.&nbsp; Mr.
Howard also named and described Joseph Wright, of Meresby, as a man
who would help her, and he gave minute local information.&nbsp; Next
came a phantom of a man whose name Mrs. Claughton is not free to give;
<a name="citation182"></a><a href="#footnote182">{182}</a> he seemed
to be in great trouble, at first covering his face with his hands, but
later removing them.&nbsp; These three spectres were to meet Mrs. Claughton
in Meresby Church and give her information of importance on a matter
concerning, apparently, the third and only unhappy appearance.&nbsp;
After these promises and injunctions the phantoms left, and Mrs. Claughton
went to the door to look at the clock.&nbsp; Feeling faint, she rang
the alarum, when her friends came and found her in a swoon on the floor.&nbsp;
The hour was 1.20.</p>
<p>What Mrs. Claughton&rsquo;s children were doing all this time, and
whether they were in the room or not, does not appear.</p>
<p>On Thursday Mrs. Claughton went to town, and her governess was perturbed,
as we have seen.</p>
<p>On Friday night Mrs. Claughton <i>dreamed</i> a number of things
connected with her journey; a page of the notes made from this dream
was shown to Mr. Myers.&nbsp; Thus her half ticket was not to be taken,
she was to find a Mr. Francis, concerned in the private affairs of the
ghosts, which needed rectifying, and so forth.&nbsp; These premonitions,
with others, were all fulfilled.&nbsp; Mrs. Claughton, in the church
at night, continued her conversation with the ghosts whose acquaintance
she had made at Rapingham.&nbsp; She obtained, it seems, all the information
needful to settling the mysterious matters which disturbed the male
ghost who hid his face, and on Monday morning she visited the daughter
of Mr. Howard in her country house in a park, &ldquo;recognised the
strong likeness to her father, and carried out all things desired by
the dead to the full, as had been requested. . . .&nbsp; The wishes
expressed to her were perfectly rational, reasonable and of natural
importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk, Wright, attests the accuracy of Mrs. Claughton&rsquo;s
description of Mr. Howard, whom he knew, and the correspondence of her
dates with those in the parish register and on the graves, which he
found for her at her request.&nbsp; Mr. Myers, &ldquo;from a very partial
knowledge&rdquo; of what the Meresby ghosts&rsquo; business was, thinks
the reasons for not revealing this matter &ldquo;entirely sufficient&rdquo;.&nbsp;
The ghosts&rsquo; messages to survivors &ldquo;effected the intended
results,&rdquo; says Mrs. Claughton.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Of this story the only conceivable natural explanation is that Mrs.
Claughton, to serve her private ends, paid secret preliminary visits
to Meresby, &ldquo;got up&rdquo; there a number of minute facts, chose
a haunted house at the other end of England as a first scene in her
little drama, and made the rest of the troublesome journeys, not to
mention the uncomfortable visit to a dark church at midnight, and did
all this from a hysterical love of notoriety.&nbsp; This desirable boon
she would probably never have obtained, even as far as it is consistent
with a pseudonym, if I had not chanced to dine with Dr. Ferrier while
the adventure was only beginning.&nbsp; As there seemed to be a chance
of taking a ghost &ldquo;on the half volley,&rdquo; I at once communicated
the first part of the tale to the Psychical Society (using pseudonyms,
as here, throughout), and two years later Mrs. Claughton consented to
tell the Society as much as she thinks it fair to reveal.</p>
<p>This, it will be confessed, is a round-about way of obtaining fame,
and an ordinary person in Mrs. Claughton&rsquo;s position would have
gone to the Psychical Society at once, as Mark Twain meant to do when
he saw the ghost which turned out to be a very ordinary person.</p>
<p>There I leave these ghosts, my mind being in a just balance of agnosticism.&nbsp;
If ghosts at all, they were ghosts with a purpose.&nbsp; The species
is now very rare.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ghost in the following instance was trivial, but
was successfully accomplished.&nbsp; In place of asking people to do
what it wanted, the ghost did the thing itself.&nbsp; Now the modern
theory of ghosts, namely, that they are delusions of the senses of the
seers, caused somehow by the mental action of dead or distant people,
does not seem to apply in this case.&nbsp; The ghost produced an effect
on a material object.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;PUT OUT THE LIGHT!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The Rev. D. W. G. Gwynne, M.D., was a physician in holy orders.&nbsp;
In 1853 he lived at P--- House, near Taunton, where both he and his
wife &ldquo;were made uncomfortable by auditory experiences to which
they could find no clue,&rdquo; or, in common English, they heard mysterious
noises.&nbsp; &ldquo;During the night,&rdquo; writes Dr. Gwynne, &ldquo;I
became aware of a draped figure passing across the foot of the bed towards
the fireplace.&nbsp; I had the impression that the arm was raised, pointing
with the hand towards the mantel-piece on which a night-light was burning.&nbsp;
Mrs. Gwynne at the same moment seized my arm, <i>and the light was extinguished</i>!&nbsp;
Notwithstanding, I distinctly saw the figure returning towards the door,
and being under the impression that one of the servants had found her
way into our room, I leaped out of bed to intercept the intruder, but
found and saw nothing.&nbsp; I rushed to the door and endeavoured to
follow the supposed intruder, and it was not until I found the door
locked, as usual, that I was painfully impressed.&nbsp; I need hardly
say that Mrs. Gwynne was in a very nervous state.&nbsp; She asked me
what I had seen, and I told her.&nbsp; She had seen the same figure,&rdquo;
&ldquo;but,&rdquo; writes Mrs. Gwynne, &ldquo;I distinctly <i>saw the
hand of the figure placed over the night-light</i>, <i>which was at
once extinguished</i>&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Gwynne also heard the
rustle of the &lsquo;tall man-like figure&rsquo;s&rsquo; garments.&nbsp;
In addition to the night-light there was moonlight in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other people had suffered many things in the same house, unknown
to Dr. and Mrs. Gwynne, who gave up the place soon afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In plenty of stories we hear of ghosts who draw curtains or open
doors, and these apparent material effects are usually called part of
the seer&rsquo;s delusion.&nbsp; But the night-light certainly went
out under the figure&rsquo;s hand, and was relit by Dr. Gwynne.&nbsp;
Either the ghost was an actual entity, not a mere hallucination of two
people, or the extinction of the light was a curious coincidence. <a name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186">{186}</a></p>

Little Hands.</i></p>
<p>Haunted houses have been familiar to man ever since he has owned
a roof to cover his head.&nbsp; The Australian blacks possessed only
shelters or &ldquo;leans-to,&rdquo; so in Australia the spirits do their
rapping on the tree trunks; a native illustrated this by whacking a
table with a book.&nbsp; The perched-up houses of the Dyaks are haunted
by noisy routing agencies.&nbsp; We find them in monasteries, palaces,
and crofters&rsquo; cottages all through the Middle Ages.&nbsp; On an
ancient Egyptian papyrus we find the husband of the Lady Onkhari protesting
against her habit of haunting his house, and exclaiming: &ldquo;What
wrong have I done,&rdquo; exactly in the spirit of the &ldquo;Hymn of
Donald Ban,&rdquo; who was &ldquo;sair hadden down by a bodach&rdquo;
(noisy bogle) after Culloden. <a name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a">{188a}</a></p>
<p>The husband of Onkhari does not say <i>how</i> she disturbed him,
but the manners of Egyptian haunters, just what they remain at present,
may be gathered from a magical papyrus, written in Greek.&nbsp; Spirits
&ldquo;wail and groan, or laugh dreadfully&rdquo;; they cause bad dreams,
terror and madness; finally, they &ldquo;practice stealthy theft,&rdquo;
and rap and knock.&nbsp; The &ldquo;theft&rdquo; (by making objects
disappear mysteriously) is often illustrated in the following tales,
as are the groaning and knocking. <a name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b">{188b}</a>&nbsp;
St. Augustine speaks of hauntings as familiar occurrences, and we have
a chain of similar cases from ancient Egypt to 1896.&nbsp; Several houses
in that year were so disturbed that the inhabitants were obliged to
leave them.&nbsp; The newspapers were full of correspondence on the
subject.</p>
<p>The usual annoyances are apparitions (rare), flying about of objects
(not very common), noises of every kind (extremely frequent), groans,
screams, footsteps and fire-raising.&nbsp; Imposture has either been
proved or made very probable in ten out of eleven cases of volatile
objects between 1883 and 1895. <a name="citation188c"></a><a href="#footnote188c">{188c}</a>&nbsp;
Moreover, it is certain that the noises of haunted houses are not equally
audible by all persons present, even when the sounds are at their loudest.&nbsp;
Thus Lord St. Vincent, the great admiral, heard nothing during his stay
at the house of his sister, Mrs. Ricketts, while that lady endured terrible
things.&nbsp; After his departure she was obliged to recall him.&nbsp;
He arrived, and slept peacefully.&nbsp; Next day his sister told him
about the disturbances, after which he heard them as much as his neighbours,
and was as unsuccessful in discovering their cause. <a name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189">{189}</a></p>
<p>Of course this looks as if these noises were unreal, children of
the imagination.&nbsp; Noises being the staple of haunted houses, a
few words may be devoted to them.&nbsp; They are usually the <i>frou-frou</i>
or rustling sweep of a gown, footsteps, raps, thumps, groans, a sound
as if all the heavy furniture was being knocked about, crashing of crockery
and jingling of money.&nbsp; Of course, as to footsteps, people <i>may</i>
be walking about, and most of the other noises are either easily imitated,
or easily produced by rats, water pipes, cracks in furniture (which
the Aztecs thought ominous of death), and other natural causes.&nbsp;
The explanation is rather more difficult when the steps pace a gallery,
passing and repassing among curious inquirers, or in this instance.</p>
<h3>THE CREAKING STAIR</h3>
<p>A lady very well known to myself, and in literary society, lived
as a girl with an antiquarian father in an old house dear to an antiquary.&nbsp;
It was haunted, among other things, by footsteps.&nbsp; The old oak
staircase had two creaking steps, numbers seventeen and eighteen from
the top.&nbsp; The girl would sit on the stair, stretching out her arms,
and count the steps as they passed her, one, two, three, and so on to
seventeen and eighteen, <i>which always creaked</i>. <a name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190">{190}</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this case rats and similar causes were excluded, though we may allow
for &ldquo;expectant attention&rdquo;.&nbsp; But this does not generally
work.&nbsp; When people sit up on purpose to look out for the ghost,
he rarely comes; in the case of the &ldquo;Lady in Black,&rdquo; which
we give later, when purposely waited for, she was never seen at all.</p>
<p>Discounting imposture, which is sometimes found, and sometimes merely
fabled (as in the Tedworth story), there remains one curious circumstance.&nbsp;
Specially ghostly noises are attributed to the living but absent.</p>
<h3>THE GROCER&rsquo;S COUGH</h3>
<p>A man of letters was born in a small Scotch town, where his father
was the intimate friend of a tradesman whom we shall call the grocer.&nbsp;
Almost every day the grocer would come to have a chat with Mr. Mackay,
and the visitor, alone of the natives, had the habit of knocking at
the door before entering.&nbsp; One day Mr. Mackay said to his daughter,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mr. Macwilliam&rsquo;s knock.&nbsp; Open the door.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But there was no Mr. Macwilliam!&nbsp; He was just leaving his house
at the other end of the street.&nbsp; From that day Mr. Mackay always
heard the grocer&rsquo;s knock &ldquo;a little previous,&rdquo; accompanied
by the grocer&rsquo;s cough, which was peculiar.&nbsp; Then all the
family heard it, including the son who later became learned.&nbsp; He,
when he had left his village for Glasgow, reasoned himself out of the
opinion that the grocer&rsquo;s knock did herald and precede the grocer.&nbsp;
But when he went home for a visit he found that he heard it just as
of old.&nbsp; Possibly some local Sentimental Tommy watched for the
grocer, played the trick and ran away.&nbsp; This explanation presents
no difficulty, but the boy was never detected. <a name="citation191"></a><a href="#footnote191">{191}</a></p>
<p>Such anecdotes somehow do not commend themselves to the belief even
of people who can believe a good deal.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;the spirits of the living,&rdquo; as the Highlanders say,
have surely as good a chance to knock, or appear at a distance, as the
spirits of the dead.&nbsp; To be sure, the living do not know (unless
they are making a scientific experiment) what trouble they are giving
on these occasions, but one can only infer, like St. Augustine, that
probably the dead don&rsquo;t know it either.</p>
<p>Thus,</p>
<h3>MY GILLIE&rsquo;S FATHER&rsquo;S STORY</h3>
<p>Fishing in Sutherland, I had a charming companion in the gillie.&nbsp;
He was well educated, a great reader, the best of salmon fishers, and
I never heard a man curse William, Duke of Cumberland, with more enthusiasm.&nbsp;
His father, still alive, was second-sighted, and so, to a moderate extent
and without theory, was my friend.&nbsp; Among other anecdotes (confirmed
in writing by the old gentleman) was this:&mdash;</p>
<p>The father had a friend who died in the house which they both occupied.&nbsp;
The clothes of the deceased hung on pegs in the bedroom.&nbsp; One night
the father awoke, and saw a stranger examining and handling the clothes
of the defunct.&nbsp; Then came a letter from the dead man&rsquo;s brother,
inquiring about the effects.&nbsp; He followed later, and was the stranger
seen by my gillie&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Thus the living but absent may haunt a house both noisily and by
actual appearance.&nbsp; The learned even think, for very exquisite
reasons, that &ldquo;Silverton Abbey&rdquo; <a name="citation192"></a><a href="#footnote192">{192}</a>
is haunted noisily by a &ldquo;spirit of the living&rdquo;.&nbsp; Here
is a case:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE DREAM THAT KNOCKED AT THE DOOR</h3>
<p>The following is an old but good story.&nbsp; The Rev. Joseph Wilkins
died, an aged man, in 1800.&nbsp; He left this narrative, often printed;
the date of the adventure is 1754, when Mr. Wilkins, aged twenty-three,
was a schoolmaster in Devonshire.&nbsp; The dream was an ordinary dream,
and did not announce death, or anything but a journey.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins
dreamed, in Devonshire, that he was going to London.&nbsp; He thought
he would go by Gloucestershire and see his people.&nbsp; So he started,
arrived at his father&rsquo;s house, found the front door locked, went
in by the back door, went to his parents&rsquo; room, saw his father
asleep in bed and his mother awake.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;Mother, I
am going a long journey, and have come to bid you good-bye&rdquo;.&nbsp;
She answered in a fright, &ldquo;Oh dear son, thou art dead!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Wilkins wakened, and thought nothing of it.&nbsp; As early as a
letter could come, one arrived from his father, addressing him as if
he were dead, and desiring him, if by accident alive, or any one into
whose hands the letter might fall, to write at once.&nbsp; The father
then gave his reasons for alarm.&nbsp; Mrs. Wilkins, being awake one
night, heard some one try the front door, enter by the back, then saw
her son come into her room and say he was going on a long journey, with
the rest of the dialogue.&nbsp; She then woke her husband, who said
she had been dreaming, but who was alarmed enough to write the letter.&nbsp;
No harm came of it to anybody.</p>
<p>The story would be better if Mr. Wilkins, junior, like Laud, had
kept a nocturnal of his dreams, and published his father&rsquo;s letter,
with post-marks.</p>
<p>The story of the lady who often dreamed of a house, and when by chance
she found and rented it was recognised as the ghost who had recently
haunted it, is good, but is an invention!</p>
<p>A somewhat similar instance is that of the uproar of moving heavy
objects, heard by Scott in Abbotsford on the night preceding and the
night of the death of his furnisher, Mr. Bullock, in London.&nbsp; The
story is given in Lockhart&rsquo;s <i>Life of Scott</i>, and is too
familiar for repetition.</p>
<p>On the whole, accepting one kind of story on the same level as the
other kind, the living and absent may unconsciously produce the phenomena
of haunted houses just as well as the dead, to whose alleged performances
we now advance.&nbsp; Actual appearances, as we have said, are not common,
and just as all persons do not hear the sounds, so many do not see the
appearance, even when it is visible to others in the same room.&nbsp;
As an example, take a very mild and lady-like case of haunting.</p>
<h3>THE GIRL IN PINK</h3>
<p>The following anecdote was told to myself, a few months after the
curious event, by the three witnesses in the case.&nbsp; They were connections
of my own, the father was a clergyman of the Anglican Church; he, his
wife and their daughter, a girl of twenty, were the &ldquo;percipients&rdquo;.&nbsp;
All are cheerful, sagacious people, and all, though they absolutely
agreed as to the facts in their experience, professed an utter disbelief
in &ldquo;ghosts,&rdquo; which the occurrence has not affected in any
way.&nbsp; They usually reside in a foreign city, where there is a good
deal of English society.&nbsp; One day they left the town to lunch with
a young fellow-countryman who lived in a villa in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
There he was attempting to farm a small estate, with what measure of
success the story does not say.&nbsp; His house was kept by his sister,
who was present, of course, at the little luncheon party.&nbsp; During
the meal some question was asked, or some remark was made, to which
the clerical guest replied in English by a reference to &ldquo;the maid-servant
in pink&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no maid in pink,&rdquo; said the host, and he asked
both his other guests to corroborate him.</p>
<p>Both ladies, mother and daughter, were obliged to say that unless
their eyes deceived them, they certainly <i>had</i> seen a girl in pink
attending on them, or, at least, moving about in the room.&nbsp; To
this their entertainers earnestly replied that no such person was in
their establishment, that they had no woman servant but the elderly
cook and housekeeper, then present, who was neither a girl nor in pink.&nbsp;
After luncheon the guests were taken all over the house, to convince
them of the absence of the young woman whom they had seen, and assuredly
there was no trace of her.</p>
<p>On returning to the town where they reside, they casually mentioned
the circumstance as a curious illusion.&nbsp; The person to whom they
spoke said, with some interest, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that a girl
is said to have been murdered in that house before your friends took
it, and that she is reported to be occasionally seen, dressed in pink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had heard of no such matter, but the story seemed to be pretty
generally known, though naturally disliked by the occupant of the house.&nbsp;
As for the percipients, they each and all remain firm in the belief
that, till convinced of the impossibility of her presence, they were
certain they had seen a girl in pink, and rather a pretty girl, whose
appearance suggested nothing out of the common.&nbsp; An obvious hypothesis
is discounted, of course, by the presence of the sister of the young
gentleman who farmed the estate and occupied the house.</p>
<p>Here is another case, mild but pertinacious.</p>
<h3>THE DOG IN THE HAUNTED ROOM</h3>
<p>The author&rsquo;s friend, Mr. Rokeby, lives, and has lived for some
twenty years, in an old house at Hammersmith.&nbsp; It is surrounded
by a large garden, the drawing-room and dining-room are on the right
and left of the entrance from the garden, on the ground floor.&nbsp;
My friends had never been troubled by any phenomena before, and never
expected to be.&nbsp; However, they found the house &ldquo;noisy,&rdquo;
the windows were apt to be violently shaken at night and steps used
to be heard where no steps should be.&nbsp; Deep long sighs were audible
at all times of day.&nbsp; As Mrs. Rokeby approached a door, the handle
would turn and the door fly open. <a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196">{196}</a>&nbsp;
Sounds of stitching a hard material, and of dragging a heavy weight
occurred in Mrs. Rokeby&rsquo;s room, and her hair used to be pulled
in a manner for which she could not account.&nbsp; &ldquo;These sorts
of things went on for about five years, when in October, 1875, about
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, I was sitting&rdquo; (says Mrs.
Rokeby) &ldquo;with three of my children in the dining-room, reading
to them.&nbsp; I rang the bell for the parlour-maid, when the door opened,
and on looking up I saw the figure of a woman come in and walk up to
the side of the table, stand there a second or two, and then turn to
go out again, but before reaching the door she seemed to dissolve away.&nbsp;
She was a grey, short-looking woman, apparently dressed in grey muslin.&nbsp;
I hardly saw the face, which seemed scarcely to be defined at all.&nbsp;
None of the children saw her,&rdquo; and Mrs. Rokeby only mentioned
the affair at the time to her husband.</p>
<p>Two servants, in the next two months, saw the same figure, alike
in dress at least, in other rooms both by daylight and candle light.&nbsp;
They had not heard of Mrs. Rokeby&rsquo;s experience, were accustomed
to the noises, and were in good health.&nbsp; One of them was frightened,
and left her place.</p>
<p>A brilliant light in a dark room, an icy wind and a feeling of being
&ldquo;watched&rdquo; were other discomforts in Mrs. Rokeby&rsquo;s
lot.&nbsp; After 1876, only occasional rappings were heard, till Mr.
Rokeby being absent one night in 1883, the noises broke out, &ldquo;banging,
thumping, the whole place shaking&rdquo;.&nbsp; The library was the
centre of these exercises, and the dog, a fine collie, was shut up in
the library.&nbsp; Mrs. Rokeby left her room for her daughter&rsquo;s,
while the dog whined in terror, and the noises increased in violence.&nbsp;
Next day the dog, when let out, rushed forth with enthusiasm, but crouched
with his tail between his legs when invited to re-enter.</p>
<p>This was in 1883.&nbsp; Several years after, Mr. Rokeby was smoking,
alone, in the dining-room early in the evening, when the dog began to
bristle up his hair, and bark.&nbsp; Mr. Rokeby looked up and saw the
woman in grey, with about half her figure passed through the slightly
open door.&nbsp; He ran to the door, but she was gone, and the servants
were engaged in their usual business. <a name="citation198a"></a><a href="#footnote198a">{198a}</a></p>
<p>Our next ghost offered many opportunities to observers.</p>
<h3>THE LADY IN BLACK</h3>
<p>A ghost in a haunted house is seldom observed with anything like
scientific precision.&nbsp; The spectre in the following narrative could
not be photographed, attempts being usually made in a light which required
prolonged exposure.&nbsp; Efforts to touch it were failures, nor did
it speak.&nbsp; On the other hand, it did lend itself, perhaps unconsciously,
to one scientific experiment.&nbsp; The story is unromantic; the names
are fictitious. <a name="citation198b"></a><a href="#footnote198b">{198b}</a></p>
<p>Bognor House, an eligible family residence near a large town, was
built in 1860, and occupied, till his death in 1876, by Mr. S.&nbsp;
He was twice married, and was not of temperate ways.&nbsp; His second
wife adopted his habits, left him shortly before his death, and died
at Clifton in 1878.&nbsp; The pair used to quarrel about some jewels
which Mr. S. concealed in the flooring of a room where the ghost was
never seen.</p>
<p>A Mr L. now took the house, but died six months later.&nbsp; Bognor
House stood empty for four years, during which there was vague talk
of hauntings.&nbsp; In April, 1882, the house was taken by Captain Morton.&nbsp;
This was in April; in June Miss Rose Morton, a lady of nineteen studying
medicine (and wearing spectacles), saw the first appearance.&nbsp; Miss
Morton did not mention her experiences to her family, her mother being
an invalid, and her brothers and sisters very young, but she transmitted
accounts to a friend, a lady, in a kind of diary letters.&nbsp; These
are extant, and are quoted.</p>
<p>Phenomena of this kind usually begin with noises, and go on to apparitions.&nbsp;
Miss Morton one night, while preparing to go to bed, heard a noise outside,
thought it was her mother, opened the door, saw a tall lady in black
holding a handkerchief to her face, and followed the figure till her
candle burned out.&nbsp; A widow&rsquo;s white cuff was visible on each
wrist, the whole of the face was never seen.&nbsp; In 1882-84, Miss
Morton saw the figure about six times; it was thrice seen, once through
the window from outside, by other persons, who took it for a living
being.&nbsp; Two boys playing in the garden ran in to ask who was the
weeping lady in black.</p>
<p>On 29th January, 1884, Miss Morton spoke to her inmate, as the lady
in black stood beside a sofa.&nbsp; &ldquo;She only gave a slight gasp
and moved towards the door.&nbsp; Just by the door I spoke to her again,
but she seemed as if she were quite unable to speak.&rdquo; <a name="citation199"></a><a href="#footnote199">{199}</a>&nbsp;
In May and June Miss Morton fastened strings at different heights from
the stair railings to the wall, where she attached them with glue, but
she twice saw the lady pass through the cords, leaving them untouched.&nbsp;
When Miss Morton cornered the figure and tried to touch her, or pounce
on her, she dodged, or disappeared.&nbsp; But by a curious contradiction
her steps were often heard by several of the family, and when she heard
the steps, Miss Morton used to go out and follow the figure.&nbsp; There
is really no more to tell.&nbsp; Miss Morton&rsquo;s father never saw
the lady, even when she sat on a sofa for half an hour, Miss Morton
watching her.&nbsp; Other people saw her in the garden crying, and sent
messages to ask what was the matter, and who was the lady in distress.&nbsp;
Many members of the family, boys, girls, married ladies, servants and
others often saw the lady in black.&nbsp; In 1885 loud noises, bumps
and turning of door handles were common, and though the servants were
told that the lady was quite harmless, they did not always stay.&nbsp;
The whole establishment of servants was gradually changed, but the lady
still walked.&nbsp; She appeared more seldom in 1887-1889, and by 1892
even the light footsteps ceased.&nbsp; Two dogs, a retriever and a Skye
terrier, showed much alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twice,&rdquo; says Miss Morton,
&ldquo;I saw the terrier suddenly run up to the mat at the foot of the
stairs in the hall, wagging its tail, and moving its back in the way
dogs do when they expect to be caressed.&nbsp; It jumped up, fawning
as it would do if a person had been standing there, but suddenly slunk
away with its tail between its legs, and retreated, trembling, under
a sofa.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Morton&rsquo;s own emotion, at first, was
&ldquo;a feeling of awe at something unknown, mixed with a strong desire
to know more about it&rdquo;. <a name="citation200"></a><a href="#footnote200">{200}</a></p>
<p>This is a pretty tame case of haunting, as was conjectured, by an
unhappy <i>revenant</i>, the returned spirit of the second Mrs. S.&nbsp;
Here it may be remarked that apparitions in haunted houses are very
seldom recognised as those of dead persons, and, when recognised, the
recognition is usually dubious.&nbsp; Thus, in February, 1897, Lieutenant
Carr Glyn, of the Grenadiers, while reading in the outer room of the
Queen&rsquo;s Library in Windsor, saw a lady in black in a kind of mantilla
of black lace pass from the inner room into a corner where she was lost
to view.&nbsp; He supposed that she had gone out by a door there, and
asked an attendant later who she was.&nbsp; There was no door round
the corner, and, in the opinion of some, the lady was Queen Elizabeth!&nbsp;
She has a traditional habit, it seems, of haunting the Library.&nbsp;
But surely, of all people, in dress and aspect Queen Elizabeth is most
easily recognised.&nbsp; The seer did not recognise her, and she was
probably a mere casual hallucination.&nbsp; In old houses such traditions
are common, but vague.&nbsp; In this connection Glamis is usually mentioned.&nbsp;
Every one has heard of the Secret Chamber, with its mystery, and the
story was known to Scott, who introduces it in <i>The Betrothed</i>.&nbsp;
But we know when the Secret Chamber was built (under the Restoration),
who built it, what he paid the masons, and where it is: under the Charter
Room. <a name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201">{201}</a>&nbsp;
These cold facts rather take the &ldquo;weird&rdquo; effect off the
Glamis legend.</p>
<p>The usual process is, given an old house, first a noise, then a hallucination,
actual or pretended, then a myth to account for the hallucination.&nbsp;
There is a castle on the border which has at least seven or eight distinct
ghosts.&nbsp; One is the famous Radiant Boy.&nbsp; He has been evicted
by turning his tapestried chamber into the smoking-room.&nbsp; For many
years not one ghost has been seen except the lady with the candle, viewed
by myself, but, being ignorant of the story, I thought she was one of
the maids.&nbsp; Perhaps she was, but she went into an empty set of
rooms, and did not come out again.&nbsp; Footsteps are apt to approach
the doors of these rooms in mirk midnight, the door handle turns, and
that is all.</p>
<p>So much for supposed hauntings by spirits of the dead.</p>
<p>At the opposite pole are hauntings by agencies whom nobody supposes
to be ghosts of inmates of the house.&nbsp; The following is an extreme
example, as the haunter proceeded to arson.&nbsp; This is not so very
unusual, and, if managed by an impostor, shows insane malevolence. <a name="citation202"></a><a href="#footnote202">{202}</a></p>
<h3>THE DANCING DEVIL</h3>
<p>On 16th November, 1870, Mr. Shchapoff, a Russian squire, the narrator,
came home from a visit to a country town, Iletski, and found his family
in some disarray.&nbsp; There lived with him his mother and his wife&rsquo;s
mother, ladies of about sixty-nine, his wife, aged twenty, and his baby
daughter.&nbsp; The ladies had been a good deal disturbed.&nbsp; On
the night of the 14th, the baby was fractious, and the cook, Maria,
danced and played the harmonica to divert her.&nbsp; The baby fell asleep,
the wife and Mr. Shchapoff&rsquo;s miller&rsquo;s lady were engaged
in conversation, when a shadow crossed the blind on the outside.&nbsp;
They were about to go out and see who was passing, when they heard a
double shuffle being executed with energy in the loft overhead.&nbsp;
They thought Maria, the cook, was making a night of it, but found her
asleep in the kitchen.&nbsp; The dancing went on but nobody could be
found in the loft.&nbsp; Then raps began on the window panes, and so
the miller and gardener patrolled outside.&nbsp; Nobody!</p>
<p>Raps and dancing lasted through most of the night and began again
at ten in the morning.&nbsp; The ladies were incommoded and complained
of broken sleep.&nbsp; Mr. Shchapoff, hearing all this, examined the
miller, who admitted the facts, but attributed them to a pigeon&rsquo;s
nest, which he had found under the cornice.&nbsp; Satisfied with this
rather elementary hypothesis, Mr. Shchapoff sat down to read Livingstone&rsquo;s
<i>African Travels</i>.&nbsp; Presently the double shuffle sounded in
the loft.&nbsp; Mrs. Shchapoff was asleep in her bedroom, but was awakened
by loud raps.&nbsp; The window was tapped at, deafening thumps were
dealt at the outer wall, and the whole house thrilled.&nbsp; Mr. Shchapoff
rushed out with dogs and a gun, there were no footsteps in the snow,
the air was still, the full moon rode in a serene sky.&nbsp; Mr. Shchapoff
came back, and the double shuffle was sounding merrily in the empty
loft.&nbsp; Next day was no better, but the noises abated and ceased
gradually.</p>
<p>Alas, Mr. Shchapoff could not leave well alone.&nbsp; On 20th December,
to amuse a friend, he asked Maria to dance and play.&nbsp; Raps, in
tune, began on the window panes.&nbsp; Next night they returned, while
boots, slippers, and other objects, flew about with a hissing noise.&nbsp;
A piece of stuff would fly up and fall with a heavy hard thud, while
hard bodies fell soundless as a feather.&nbsp; The performances slowly
died away.</p>
<p>On Old Year&rsquo;s Night Maria danced to please them; raps began,
people watching on either side of a wall heard the raps on the other
side.&nbsp; On 8th January, Mrs. Shchapoff fainted when a large, luminous
ball floated, increasing in size, from under her bed.&nbsp; The raps
now followed her about by day, as in the case of John Wesley&rsquo;s
sisters.&nbsp; On these occasions she felt weak and somnolent.&nbsp;
Finally Mr. Shchapoff carried his family to his town house for much-needed
change of air.</p>
<p>Science, in the form of Dr. Shustoff, now hinted that electricity
or magnetic force was at the bottom of the annoyances, a great comfort
to the household, who conceived that the devil was concerned.&nbsp;
The doctor accompanied his friends to their country house for a night,
Maria was invited to oblige with a dance, and only a few taps on windows
followed.&nbsp; The family returned to town till 21st January.&nbsp;
No sooner was Mrs. Shchapoff in bed than knives and forks came out of
a closed cupboard and flew about, occasionally sticking in the walls.</p>
<p>On 24th January the doctor abandoned the hypothesis of electricity,
because the noises kept time to profane but not to sacred music.&nbsp;
A Tartar hymn by a Tartar servant, an Islamite, had no accompaniment,
but the <i>Freisch&uuml;tz</i> was warmly encored.</p>
<p>This went beyond the most intelligent spontaneous exercises of electricity.&nbsp;
Questions were asked of the agencies, and to the interrogation, &ldquo;Are
you a devil?&rdquo; a most deafening knock replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
all jumped backwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now comes a curious point.&nbsp; In the Wesley and Tedworth cases,
the masters of the houses, like the cur&eacute; of Cideville (1851),
were at odds with local &ldquo;cunning men&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. Shchapoff&rsquo;s fiend now averred that he was &ldquo;set on&rdquo;
by the servant of a neighbouring miller, with whom Mr. Shchapoff had
a dispute about a mill pond.&nbsp; This man had previously said, &ldquo;It
will be worse; they will drag you by the hair&rdquo;.&nbsp; And, indeed,
Mrs. Shchapoff was found in tears, because her hair had been pulled.
<a name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205">{205}</a></p>
<p>Science again intervened.&nbsp; A section of the Imperial Geographical
Society sent Dr. Shustoff, Mr. Akutin (a Government civil engineer),
and a literary gentleman, as a committee of inquiry appointed by the
governor of the province.&nbsp; They made a number of experiments with
Leyden jars, magnets, and so forth, with only negative results.&nbsp;
Things flew about, both <i>from</i>, and <i>towards</i> Mrs. Shchapoff.&nbsp;
Nothing volatile was ever seen to <i>begin</i> its motion, though, in
March, 1883, objects were seen, by a policeman and six other witnesses,
to fly up from a bin and out of a closed cupboard, in a house at Worksop.
<a name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206">{206}</a>&nbsp; Mr.
Akutin, in Mrs. Shchapoff&rsquo;s bedroom, found the noises answer questions
in French and German, on contemporary politics, of which the lady of
the house knew nothing.&nbsp; Lassalle was said to be alive, Mr. Shchapoff
remarked, &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; but Mr. Akutin corrected him.&nbsp;
The bogey was better informed.&nbsp; The success of the French in the
great war was predicted.</p>
<p>The family now moved to their town house, and the inquest continued,
though the raps were only heard near the lady.&nbsp; A Dr. Dubinsky
vowed that she made them herself, with her tongue; then, with her pulse.&nbsp;
The doctor assailed, and finally shook the faith of Mr. Akutin, who
was to furnish a report.&nbsp; &ldquo;He bribed a servant boy to say
that his mistress made the sounds herself, and then pretended that he
had caught her trying to deceive us by throwing things.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Finally Mr. Akutin reported that the whole affair was a hysterical imposition
by Mrs. Shchapoff.&nbsp; Dr. Dubinsky attended her, her health and spirits
improved, and the disturbances ceased.&nbsp; But poor Mr. Shchapoff
received an official warning not to do it again, from the governor of
his province.&nbsp; That way lies Siberia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine, then,&rdquo; exclaims Mr. Shchapoff, &ldquo;our horror,
when, on our return to the country in March, the unknown force at once
set to work again.&nbsp; And now even my wife&rsquo;s presence was not
essential.&nbsp; Thus, one day, I saw with my own eyes a heavy sofa
jump off all four legs (three or four times in fact), and this when
my aged mother was lying on it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same thing occurred
to Nancy Wesley&rsquo;s bed, on which she was sitting while playing
cards in 1717.&nbsp; The picture of a lady of seventy, sitting tight
to a bucking sofa, appeals to the brave.</p>
<p>Then the fire-raising began.&nbsp; A blue spark flew out of a wash-stand,
into Mrs. Shchapoff&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp; Luckily she was absent, and
her mother, rushing forward with a water-jug, extinguished a flaming
cotton dress.&nbsp; Bright red globular meteors now danced in the veranda.&nbsp;
Mr. Portnoff next takes up the tale as follows, Mr. Shchapoff having
been absent from home on the occasion described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sitting playing the guitar.&nbsp; The miller got up
to leave, and was followed by Mrs. Shchapoff.&nbsp; Hardly had she shut
the door, when I heard, as though from far off, a deep drawn wail.&nbsp;
The voice seemed familiar to me.&nbsp; Overcome with an unaccountable
horror I rushed to the door, and there in the passage I saw a literal
pillar of fire, in the middle of which, draped in flame, stood Mrs.
Shchapoff. . . . I rushed to put it out with my hands, but I found it
burned them badly, as if they were sticking to burning pitch.&nbsp;
A sort of cracking noise came from beneath the floor, which also shook
and vibrated violently.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Portnoff and the miller &ldquo;carried
off the unconscious victim&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. Shchapoff also saw a small pink hand, like a child&rsquo;s, spring
from the floor, and play with Mrs. Shchapoff&rsquo;s coverlet, in bed.&nbsp;
These things were too much; the Shchapoffs fled to a cottage, and took
a new country house.&nbsp; They had no more disturbances.&nbsp; Mrs.
Shchapoff died in child-bed, in 1878, &ldquo;a healthy, religious, quiet,
affectionate woman&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Cases like that of Mrs. Shchapoff really belong to a peculiar species
of haunted houses.&nbsp; Our ancestors, like the modern Chinese, attributed
them to diabolical possession, not to an ordinary ghost of a dead person.&nbsp;
Examples are very numerous, and have all the same &ldquo;symptoms,&rdquo;
as Coleridge would have said, he attributing them to a contagious nervous
malady of observation in the spectators.&nbsp; Among the most notorious
is the story of Willington Mill, told by Howitt, and borrowed by Mrs.
Crowe, in <i>The Night Side of Nature</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Procter, the occupant,
a Quaker, vouched to Mrs. Crowe for the authenticity of Howitt&rsquo;s
version. (22nd July, 1847.)&nbsp; Other letters from seers are published,
and the Society of Psychical Research lately printed Mr. Procter&rsquo;s
contemporary journal.&nbsp; A man, a woman, and a monkey were the chief
apparitions.&nbsp; There were noises, lights, beds were heaved about:
nothing was omitted.&nbsp; A <i>clairvoyante</i> was turned on, but
could only say that the spectral figures, which she described, &ldquo;had
no brains&rdquo;.&nbsp; After the Quakers left the house there seems
to have been no more trouble.&nbsp; The affair lasted for fifteen years.</p>
<p>Familiar as it is, we now offer the old story of the hauntings at
Epworth, mainly because a full view of the inhabitants, the extraordinary
family of Wesley, seems necessary to an understanding of the affair.&nbsp;
The famous and excessively superstitious John Wesley was not present
on the occasion.</p>
<h3>THE WESLEY GHOST</h3>
<p>No ghost story is more celebrated than that of <i>Old Jeffrey</i>,
the spirit so named by Emily Wesley, which disturbed the Rectory at
Epworth, chiefly in the December of 1716 and the spring of 1717.&nbsp;
Yet the vagueness of the human mind has led many people, especially
journalists, to suppose that the haunted house was that, not of Samuel
Wesley, but of his son John Wesley, the founder of the Wesleyan Methodists.&nbsp;
For the better intelligence of the tale, we must know who the inmates
of the Epworth Rectory were, and the nature of their characters and
pursuits.&nbsp; The rector was the Rev. Samuel Wesley, born in 1662,
the son of a clergyman banished from his living on &ldquo;Black Bartholomew
Day,&rdquo; 1666.&nbsp; Though educated among Dissenters, Samuel Wesley
converted himself to the truth as it is in the Church of England, became
a &ldquo;poor scholar&rdquo; of Exeter College in Oxford, supported
himself mainly by hack-work in literature (he was one of the editors
of a penny paper called <i>The Athenian Mercury</i>, a sort of <i>Answers</i>),
married Miss Susanna Annesley, a lady of good family, in 1690-91, and
in 1693 was presented to the Rectory of Epworth in Lincolnshire by Mary,
wife of William of Orange, to whom he had dedicated a poem on the life
of Christ.&nbsp; The living was poor, Mr. Wesley&rsquo;s family multiplied
with amazing velocity, he was in debt, and unpopular.&nbsp; His cattle
were maimed in 1705, and in 1703 his house was burned down.&nbsp; The
Rectory House, of which a picture is given in Clarke&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs
of the Wesleys</i>, 1825, was built anew at his own expense.&nbsp; Mr.
Wesley was in politics a strong Royalist, but having seen James II.
shake &ldquo;his lean arm&rdquo; at the Fellows of Magdalen College,
and threaten them &ldquo;with the weight of a king&rsquo;s right hand,&rdquo;
he conceived a prejudice against that monarch, and took the side of
the Prince of Orange.&nbsp; His wife, a very pious woman and a strict
disciplinarian, was a Jacobite, would not say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to
the prayers for &ldquo;the king,&rdquo; and was therefore deserted by
her husband for a year or more in 1701-1702.&nbsp; They came together
again, however, on the accession of Queen Anne.</p>
<p>Unpopular for his politics, hated by the Dissenters, and at odds
with the &ldquo;cunning men,&rdquo; or local wizards against whom he
had frequently preached, Mr. Wesley was certainly apt to have tricks
played on him by his neighbours.&nbsp; His house, though surrounded
by a wall, a hedge, and its own grounds, was within a few yards of the
nearest dwelling in the village street.</p>
<p>In 1716, when the disturbances began, Mr. Wesley&rsquo;s family consisted
of his wife; his eldest son, Sam, aged about twenty-three, and then
absent at his duties as an usher at Westminster; John, aged twelve,
a boy at Westminster School; Charles, a boy of eight, away from home,
and the girls, who were all at the parsonage.&nbsp; They were Emily,
about twenty-two, Mary, Nancy and Sukey, probably about twenty-one,
twenty and nineteen, and Hetty, who may have been anything between nineteen
and twelve, but who comes after John in Dr. Clarke&rsquo;s list, and
is apparently reckoned among &ldquo;the children&rdquo;. <a name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212">{212}</a>&nbsp;
Then there was Patty, who may have been only nine, and little Keziah.</p>
<p>All except Patty were very lively young people, and Hetty, afterwards
a copious poet, &ldquo;was gay and sprightly, full of mirth, good-humour,
and keen wit.&nbsp; She indulged this disposition so much that it was
said to have given great uneasiness to her parents.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
servants, Robin Brown, Betty Massy and Nancy Marshall, were recent comers,
but were acquitted by Mrs. Wesley of any share in the mischief.&nbsp;
The family, though, like other people of their date, they were inclined
to believe in witches and &ldquo;warnings,&rdquo; were not especially
superstitious, and regarded the disturbances, first with some apprehension,
then as a joke, and finally as a bore.</p>
<p>The authorities for what occurred are, first, a statement and journal
by Mr. Wesley, then a series of letters of 1717 to Sam at Westminster
by his mother, Emily and Sukey, next a set of written statements made
by these and other witnesses to John Wesley in 1726, and last and worst,
a narrative composed many years after by John Wesley for <i>The Arminian
Magazine.</i></p>
<p>The earliest document, by a few days, is the statement of Mr. Wesley,
written, with a brief journal, between 21st December, 1716, and 1st
January, 1717.&nbsp; Comparing this with Mrs. Wesley&rsquo;s letter
to Sam of 12th January, 1716 and Sukey&rsquo;s letter of 24th January,
we learn that the family for some weeks after 1st December had been
&ldquo;in the greatest panic imaginable,&rdquo; supposing that Sam,
Jack, or Charlie (who must also have been absent from home) was dead,
&ldquo;or by some misfortune killed&rdquo;.&nbsp; The reason for these
apprehensions was that on the night of 1st December the maid &ldquo;heard
at the dining-room door several dreadful groans, like a person in extremes&rdquo;.&nbsp;
They laughed at her, but for the whole of December &ldquo;the groans,
squeaks, tinglings and knockings were frightful enough&rdquo;.&nbsp;
The rest of the family (Mr. Wesley always excepted) &ldquo;heard a strange
knocking in divers places,&rdquo; chiefly in the green room, or nursery,
where (apparently) Hetty, Patty and Keziah lay.&nbsp; Emily heard the
noises later than some of her sisters, perhaps a week after the original
groans.&nbsp; She was locking up the house about ten o&rsquo;clock when
a sound came like the smashing and splintering of a huge piece of coal
on the kitchen floor.&nbsp; She and Sukey went through the rooms on
the ground floor, but found the dog asleep, the cat at the other end
of the house, and everything in order.&nbsp; From her bedroom Emily
heard a noise of breaking the empty bottles under the stairs, but was
going to bed, when Hetty, who had been sitting on the lowest step of
the garret stairs beside the nursery door, waiting for her father, was
chased into the nursery by a sound as of a man passing her in a loose
trailing gown.&nbsp; Sukey and Nancy were alarmed by loud knocks on
the outside of the dining-room door and overhead.&nbsp; All this time
Mr. Wesley heard nothing, and was not even told that anything unusual
was heard.&nbsp; Mrs. Wesley at first held her peace lest he should
think it &ldquo;according to the vulgar opinion, a warning against his
own death, which, indeed, we all apprehended&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mr. Wesley
only smiled when he was informed; but, by taking care to see all the
girls safe in bed, sufficiently showed his opinion that the young ladies
and their lovers were the ghost.&nbsp; Mrs. Wesley then fell back on
the theory of rats, and employed a man to blow a horn as a remedy against
these vermin.&nbsp; But this measure only aroused the emulation of the
sprite, whom Emily began to call &ldquo;Jeffrey&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Not till 21st December did Mr. Wesley hear anything, then came thumpings
on his bedroom wall.&nbsp; Unable to discover the cause, he procured
a stout mastiff, which soon became demoralised by his experiences.&nbsp;
On the morning of the 24th, about seven o&rsquo;clock, Emily led Mrs.
Wesley into the nursery, where she heard knocks on and under the bedstead;
these sounds replied when she knocked.&nbsp; Something &ldquo;like a
badger, with no head,&rdquo; says Emily; Mrs. Wesley only says, &ldquo;like
a badger,&rdquo; ran from under the bed.&nbsp; On the night of the 25th
there was an appalling <i>vacarme</i>.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Wesley went
on a tour of inspection, but only found the mastiff whining in terror.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We still heard it rattle and thunder in every room above or behind
us, locked as well as open, except my study, where as yet it never came.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On the night of the 26th Mr. Wesley seems to have heard of a phenomenon
already familiar to Emily&mdash;&ldquo;something like the quick winding
up of a jack, at the corner of the room by my bed head&rdquo;.&nbsp;
This was always followed by knocks, &ldquo;hollow and loud, such as
none of us could ever imitate&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mr. Wesley went into the
nursery, Hetty, Kezzy and Patty were asleep.&nbsp; The knocks were loud,
beneath and in the room, so Mr. Wesley went below to the kitchen, struck
with his stick against the rafters, and was answered &ldquo;as often
and as loud as I knocked&rdquo;.&nbsp; The peculiar knock which was
his own, 1-23456-7, was not successfully echoed at that time.&nbsp;
Mr. Wesley then returned to the nursery, which was as <i>tapageuse</i>
as ever.&nbsp; The children, three, were trembling in their sleep.&nbsp;
Mr. Wesley invited the agency to an interview in his study, was answered
by one knock outside, &ldquo;all the rest were within,&rdquo; and then
came silence.&nbsp; Investigations outside produced no result, but the
latch of the door would rise and fall, and the door itself was pushed
violently back against investigators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been with Hetty,&rdquo; says Emily, &ldquo;when it
has knocked under her, and when she has removed has followed her,&rdquo;
and it knocked under little Kezzy, when &ldquo;she stamped with her
foot, pretending to scare Patty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wesley had requested an interview in his study, especially as
the Jacobite goblin routed loudly &ldquo;over our heads constantly,
when we came to the prayers for King George and the prince&rdquo;.&nbsp;
In his study the agency pushed Mr. Wesley about, bumping him against
the corner of his desk, and against his door.&nbsp; He would ask for
a conversation, but heard only &ldquo;two or three feeble squeaks, a
little louder than the chirping of a bird, but not like the noise of
rats, which I have often heard&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. Wesley had meant to leave home for a visit on Friday, 28th December,
but the noises of the 27th were so loud that he stayed at home, inviting
the Rev. Mr. Hoole, of Haxey, to view the performances.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
noises were very boisterous and disturbing this night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Hoole says (in 1726, confirmed by Mrs. Wesley, 12th January, 1717)
that there were sounds of feet, trailing gowns, raps, and a noise as
of planing boards: the disturbance finally went outside the house and
died away.&nbsp; Mr. Wesley seems to have paid his visit on the 30th,
and notes, &ldquo;1st January, 1717.&nbsp; My family have had no disturbance
since I went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To judge by Mr. Wesley&rsquo;s letter to Sam, of 12th January, there
was no trouble between the 29th of December and that date.&nbsp; On
the 19th of January, and the 30th of the same month, Sam wrote, full
of curiosity, to his father and mother.&nbsp; Mrs. Wesley replied (25th
or 27th January), saying that no explanation could be discovered, but
&ldquo;it commonly was nearer Hetty than the rest&rdquo;.&nbsp; On 24th
January, Sukey said &ldquo;it is now pretty quiet, but still knocks
at prayers for the king.&rdquo;&nbsp; On 11th February, Mr. Wesley,
much bored by Sam&rsquo;s inquiries, says, &ldquo;we are all now quiet.
. . .&nbsp; It would make a glorious penny book for Jack Dunton,&rdquo;
his brother-in-law, a publisher of popular literature, such as the <i>Athenian
Mercury</i>.&nbsp; Emily (no date) explains the phenomena as the revenge
for her father&rsquo;s recent sermons &ldquo;against consulting those
that are called cunning men, which our people are given to, and <i>it
had a particular spite at my father</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The disturbances by no means ended in the beginning of January, nor
at other dates when a brief cessation made the Wesleys hope that Jeffrey
had returned to his own place.&nbsp; Thus on 27th March, Sukey writes
to Sam, remarking that as Hetty and Emily are also writing &ldquo;so
particularly,&rdquo; she need not say much.&nbsp; &ldquo;One thing I
believe you do not know, that is, last Sunday, to my father&rsquo;s
no small amazement, his trencher danced upon the table a pretty while,
without anybody&rsquo;s stirring the table. . . .&nbsp; Send me some
news for we are excluded from the sight or hearing of any versal thing,
except Jeffery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last mention of the affair, at this time, is in a letter from
Emily, of 1st April, to a Mr. Berry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my brother the sprite was with us last night, and heard
by many of our family.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are no other contemporary
letters preserved, but we may note Mrs. Wesley&rsquo;s opinion (25th
January) that it was &ldquo;beyond the power of any human being to make
such strange and various noises&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The next evidence is ten years after date, the statements taken down
by Jack Wesley in 1726 (1720?).&nbsp; Mrs. Wesley adds to her former
account that she &ldquo;earnestly desired it might not disturb her&rdquo;
(at her devotions) &ldquo;between five and six in the evening,&rdquo;
and it did not rout in her room at that time.&nbsp; Emily added that
a screen was knocked at on each side as she went round to the other.&nbsp;
Sukey mentioned the noise as, on one occasion, coming gradually from
the garret stairs, outside the nursery door, up to Hetty&rsquo;s bed,
&ldquo;who trembled strongly in her sleep.&nbsp; It then removed to
the room overhead, where it knocked my father&rsquo;s knock on the ground,
as if it would beat the house down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nancy said that the
noise used to follow her, or precede her, and once a bed, on which she
sat playing cards, was lifted up under her several times to a considerable
height.&nbsp; Robin, the servant, gave evidence that he was greatly
plagued with all manner of noises and movements of objects.</p>
<p>John Wesley, in his account published many years after date in his
<i>Arminian Magazine</i>, attributed the affair of 1716 to his father&rsquo;s
broken vow of deserting his mother till she recognised the Prince of
Orange as king!&nbsp; He adds that the mastiff &ldquo;used to tremble
and creep away before the noise began&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Some other peculiarities may be noted.&nbsp; All persons did not
always hear the noises.&nbsp; It was three weeks before Mr. Wesley heard
anything.&nbsp; &ldquo;John and Kitty Maw, who lived over against us,
listened several nights in the time of the disturbance, but could never
hear anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;The first time my mother ever
heard any unusual noise at Epworth was long before the disturbance of
old Jeffrey . . . the door and windows jarred very loud, and presently
several distinct strokes, three by three, were struck.&nbsp; From that
night it never failed to give notice in much the same manner, against
any signal misfortune or illness of any belonging to the family,&rdquo;
writes Jack.</p>
<p>Once more, on 10th February, 1750, Emily (now Mrs. Harper) wrote
to her brother John, &ldquo;that wonderful thing called by us Jeffery,
how certainly it calls on me against any extraordinary new affliction&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is practically all the story of Old Jeffrey.&nbsp; The explanations
have been, trickery by servants (Priestley), contagious hallucinations
(Coleridge), devilry (Southey), and trickery by Hetty Wesley (Dr. Salmon,
of Trinity College, Dublin).&nbsp; Dr. Salmon points out that there
is no evidence from Hetty; that she was a lively, humorous girl, and
he conceives that she began to frighten the maids, and only reluctantly
exhibited before her father against whom, however, Jeffrey developed
&ldquo;a particular spite&rdquo;.&nbsp; He adds that certain circumstances
were peculiar to Hetty, which, in fact, is not the case.&nbsp; The present
editor has examined Dr. Salmon&rsquo;s arguments in <i>The Contemporary
Review</i>, and shown reason, in the evidence, for acquitting Hetty
Wesley, who was never suspected by her family.</p>
<p>Trickery from without, by &ldquo;the cunning men,&rdquo; is an explanation
which, at least, provides a motive, but how the thing could be managed
from without remains a mystery.&nbsp; Sam Wesley, the friend of Pope,
and Atterbury, and Lord Oxford, not unjustly said: &ldquo;Wit, I fancy,
might find many interpretations, but wisdom none&rdquo;. <a name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220">{220}</a></p>
<p>As the Wesley tale is a very typical instance of a very large class,
our study of it may exempt us from printing the well-known parallel
case of &ldquo;The Drummer of Tedworth&rdquo;.&nbsp; Briefly, the house
of Mr. Mompesson, near Ludgarshal, in Wilts, was disturbed in the usual
way, for at least two years, from April, 1661, to April, 1663, or later.&nbsp;
The noises, and copious phenomena of moving objects apparently untouched,
were attributed to the unholy powers of a wandering drummer, deprived
by Mr. Mompesson of his drum.&nbsp; A grand jury presented the drummer
for trial, on a charge of witchcraft, but the petty jury would not convict,
there being a want of evidence to prove threats, <i>malum minatum</i>,
by the drummer.&nbsp; In 1662 the Rev. Joseph Glanvil, F.R.S., visited
the house, and, in the bedroom of Mr. Mompesson&rsquo;s little girls,
the chief sufferers, heard and saw much the same phenomena as the elder
Wesley describes in his own nursery.&nbsp; The &ldquo;little modest
girls&rdquo; were aged about seven and eight.&nbsp; Charles II. sent
some gentlemen to the house for one night, when nothing occurred, the
disturbances being intermittent.&nbsp; Glanvil published his narrative
at the time, and Mr. Pepys found it &ldquo;not very convincing&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Glanvil, in consequence of his book, was so vexed by correspondents
&ldquo;that I have been haunted almost as bad as Mr. Mompesson&rsquo;s
house&rdquo;.&nbsp; A report that imposture had been discovered, and
confessed by Mr. Mompesson, was set afloat, by John Webster, in a well-known
work, and may still be found in modern books.&nbsp; Glanvil denied it
till he was &ldquo;quite tired,&rdquo; and Mompesson gave a formal denial
in a letter dated Tedworth, 8th November, 1672.&nbsp; He also, with
many others, swore to the facts on oath, in court, at the drummer&rsquo;s
trial. <a name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221">{221}</a></p>
<p>In the Tedworth case, as at Epworth, and in the curious Cideville
case of 1851, a quarrel with &ldquo;cunning men&rdquo; preceded the
disturbances.&nbsp; In Lord St. Vincent&rsquo;s case, which follows,
nothing of the kind is reported.&nbsp; As an almost universal rule children,
especially girls of about twelve, are centres of the trouble; in the
St. Vincent story, the children alone were exempt from annoyance.</p>
<h3>LORD ST. VINCENT&rsquo;S GHOST STORY</h3>
<p>Sir Walter Scott, writing about the disturbances in the house occupied
by Mrs. Ricketts, sister of the great admiral, Lord St. Vincent, asks:
&ldquo;Who has seen Lord St. Vincent&rsquo;s letters?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
adds that the gallant admiral, after all, was a sailor, and implies
that &ldquo;what the sailor said&rdquo; (if he said anything) &ldquo;is
not evidence&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The fact of unaccountable disturbances which finally drove Mrs. Ricketts
out of Hinton Ampner, is absolutely indisputable, though the cause of
the annoyances may remain as mysterious as ever.&nbsp; The contemporary
correspondence (including that of Lord St. Vincent, then Captain Jervis)
exists, and has been edited by Mrs. Henley Jervis, grand-daughter of
Mrs. Ricketts. <a name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222">{222}</a></p>
<p>There is only the very vaguest evidence for hauntings at Lady Hillsborough&rsquo;s
old house of Hinton Ampner, near Alresford, before Mr. Ricketts took
it in January, 1765.&nbsp; He and his wife were then disturbed by footsteps,
and sounds of doors opening and shutting.&nbsp; They put new locks on
the doors lest the villagers had procured keys, but this proved of no
avail.&nbsp; The servants talked of seeing appearances of a gentleman
in drab and of a lady in silk, which Mrs. Ricketts disregarded.&nbsp;
Her husband went to Jamaica in the autumn of 1769, and in 1771 she was
so disturbed that her brother, Captain Jervis, a witness of the phenomena,
insisted on her leaving the house in August.&nbsp; He and Mrs. Ricketts
then wrote to Mr. Ricketts about the affair.&nbsp; In July, 1772, Mrs.
Ricketts wrote a long and solemn description of her sufferings, to be
given to her children.</p>
<p>We shall slightly abridge her statement, in which she mentions that
when she left Hinton she had not one of the servants who came thither
in her family, which &ldquo;evinces the impossibility of a confederacy&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Her new, like her former servants, were satisfactory; Camis, her new
coachman, was of a yeoman house of 400 years&rsquo; standing.&nbsp;
It will be observed that Mrs. Ricketts was a good deal annoyed even
<i>before</i> 2nd April, 1771, the day when she dates the beginning
of the worst disturbances.&nbsp; She believed that the agency was human&mdash;a
robber or a practical joker&mdash;and but slowly and reluctantly became
convinced that the &ldquo;exploded&rdquo; notion of an abnormal force
might be correct.&nbsp; We learn that while Captain Jervis was not informed
of the sounds he never heard them, and whereas Mrs. Ricketts heard violent
noises after he went to bed on the night of his vigil, he heard nothing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Several instances occurred where very loud noises were heard
by one or two persons, when those equally near and in the same direction
were not sensible of the least impression.&rdquo; <a name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223">{223}</a></p>
<p>With this preface, Mrs. Ricketts may be allowed to tell her own tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime after Mr. Ricketts left me (autumn, 1769) I&mdash;then
lying in the bedroom over the kitchen&mdash;heard frequently the noise
of some one walking in the room within, and the rustling as of silk
clothes against the door that opened into my room, sometimes so loud,
and of such continuance as to break my rest.&nbsp; Instant search being
often made, we never could discover any appearance of human or brute
being.&nbsp; Repeatedly disturbed in the same manner, I made it my constant
practice to search the room and closets within, and to secure the only
door on the inside. . . .&nbsp; Yet this precaution did not preclude
the disturbance, which continued with little interruption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody, in short, could enter this room, except by passing through
that of Mrs. Ricketts, the door of which &ldquo;was always made fast
by a drawn bolt&rdquo;.&nbsp; Yet somebody kept rustling and walking
in the inner room, which somebody could never be found when sought for.</p>
<p>In summer, 1770, Mrs. Ricketts heard someone walk to the foot of
her bed in her own room, &ldquo;the footsteps as distinct as ever I
heard, myself perfectly awake and collected&rdquo;.&nbsp; Nobody could
be discovered in the chamber.&nbsp; Mrs. Ricketts boldly clung to her
room, and was only now and then disturbed by &ldquo;sounds of harmony,&rdquo;
and heavy thumps, down stairs.&nbsp; After this, and early in 1771,
she was &ldquo;frequently sensible of a hollow murmuring that seemed
to possess the whole house: it was independent of wind, being equally
heard on the calmest nights, and it was a sound I had never been accustomed
to hear&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On 27th February, 1771, a maid was alarmed by &ldquo;groans and fluttering
round her bed&rdquo;: she was &ldquo;the sister of an eminent grocer
in Alresford&rdquo;.&nbsp; On 2nd April, Mrs. Ricketts heard people
walking in the lobby, hunted for burglars, traced the sounds to a room
whence their was no outlet, and found nobody.&nbsp; This kind of thing
went on till Mrs. Ricketts despaired of any natural explanation.&nbsp;
After mid-summer, 1771, the trouble increased, in broad daylight, and
a shrill female voice, answered by two male voices was added to the
afflictions.&nbsp; Captain Jervis came on a visit, but was told of nothing,
and never heard anything.&nbsp; After he went to Portsmouth, &ldquo;the
most deep, loud tremendous noise seemed to rush and fall with infinite
velocity and force on the lobby floor adjoining my room,&rdquo; accompanied
by a shrill and dreadful shriek, seeming to proceed from under the spot
where the rushing noise fell, and repeated three or four times.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ricketts&rsquo; &ldquo;resolution remained firm,&rdquo; but
her health was impaired; she tried changing her room, without results.&nbsp;
The disturbances pursued her.&nbsp; Her brother now returned.&nbsp;
She told him nothing, and he heard nothing, but next day she unbosomed
herself.&nbsp; Captain Jervis therefore sat up with Captain Luttrell
and his own man.&nbsp; He was rewarded by noises which he in vain tried
to pursue.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should do great injustice to my sister&rdquo;
(he writes to Mr. Ricketts on 9th August, 1771), &ldquo;if I did not
acknowledge to have heard what I could not, after the most diligent
search and serious reflection, any way account for.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain
Jervis during a whole week slept by day, and watched, armed, by night.&nbsp;
Even by day he was disturbed by a sound as of immense weights falling
from the ceiling to the floor of his room.&nbsp; He finally obliged
his sister to leave the house.</p>
<p>What occurred after Mrs. Ricketts abandoned Hinton is not very distinct.&nbsp;
Apparently Captain Jervis&rsquo;s second stay of a week, when he did
hear the noises, was from 1st August to 8th August.&nbsp; From a statement
by Mrs. Ricketts it appears that, when her brother joined his ship,
the <i>Alarm</i> (9th August), she retired to Dame Camis&rsquo;s house,
that of her coachman&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; Thence she went, and made
another attempt to live at Hinton, but was &ldquo;soon after assailed
by a noise I never before heard, very near me, and the terror I felt
not to be described&rdquo;.&nbsp; She therefore went to the Newbolts,
and thence to the old Palace at Winton; later, on Mr. Ricketts&rsquo;
return, to the Parsonage, and then to Longwood (to the <i>old</i> house
there) near Alresford.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on 18th September, Lady Hillsborough&rsquo;s agent lay
with armed men at Hinton, and, making no discovery, offered &pound;50
(increased by Mr. Ricketts to &pound;100) for the apprehension of the
persons who caused the noises.&nbsp; The reward was never claimed.&nbsp;
On 8th March, 1772, Camis wrote: &ldquo;I am very sorry that we cannot
find out the reason of the noise&rdquo;; at other dates he mentions
sporadic noises heard by his mother and another woman, including &ldquo;the
murmur&rdquo;.&nbsp; A year after Mrs. Ricketts left a family named
Lawrence took the house, and, according to old Lucy Camis, in 1818,
Mr. Lawrence very properly threatened to dismiss any servant who spoke
of the disturbances.&nbsp; The result of this sensible course was that
the Lawrences left suddenly, at the end of the year&mdash;and the house
was pulled down.&nbsp; Some old political papers of the Great Rebellion,
and a monkey&rsquo;s skull, not exhibited to any anatomist, are said
to have been discovered under the floor of the lobby, or of one of the
rooms.&nbsp; Mrs. Ricketts adds sadly, &ldquo;The unbelief of Chancellor
Hoadley went nearest my heart,&rdquo; as he had previously a high opinion
of her veracity.&nbsp; The Bishop of St. Asaph was incredulous, &ldquo;on
the ground that such means were unworthy of the Deity to employ&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Probably a modern bishop would say that there were no noises at all,
that every one who heard the sounds was under the influence of &ldquo;suggestion,&rdquo;
caused first in Mrs. Ricketts&rsquo; own mind by vague tales of a gentleman
in drab seen by the servants.</p>
<p>The contagion, to be sure, also reached two distinguished captains
in the navy, but not till one of them was told about disturbances which
had not previously disturbed him.&nbsp; If this explanation be true,
it casts an unusual light on the human imagination.&nbsp; Physical science
has lately invented a new theory.&nbsp; Disturbances of this kind are
perhaps &ldquo;seismic,&rdquo;&mdash;caused by earthquakes!&nbsp; (See
Professor Milne, in <i>The Times</i>, 21st June, 1897.)</p>

<h3>MORE HAUNTED HOUSES</h3>
<p>A physician, as we have seen, got the better of the demon in Mrs.
Shchapoff&rsquo;s case, at least while the lady was under his care.&nbsp;
Really these disturbances appear to demand the attention of medical
men.&nbsp; If the whole phenomena are caused by imposture, the actors,
or actresses, display a wonderful similarity of symptoms and an alarming
taste for fire-raising.&nbsp; Professor William James, the well-known
psychologist, mentions ten cases whose resemblances &ldquo;suggest a
natural type,&rdquo; and we ask, is it a type of hysterical disease?
<a name="citation229"></a><a href="#footnote229">{229}</a>&nbsp; He
chooses, among others, an instance in Dr. Nevius&rsquo;s book on <i>Demon
Possession in China</i>, and there is another in Peru.&nbsp; He also
mentions <i>The Great Amherst Mystery</i>, which we give, and the Rerrick
case in Scotland (1696), related by Telfer, who prints, on his margins,
the names of the attesting witnesses of each event, lairds, clergymen,
and farmers.&nbsp; At Rerrick, as in Russia, the <i>little hand</i>
was seen by Telfer himself, and the fire-raising was endless.&nbsp;
At Amherst too, as in a pair of recent Russian cases and others, there
was plenty of fire-raising.&nbsp; By a lucky chance an English case
occurred at Wem, in Shropshire, in November, 1883.&nbsp; It began at
a farm called the Woods, some ten miles from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; First
a saucepan full of eggs &ldquo;jumped&rdquo; off the fire in the kitchen,
and the tea-things, leaping from the table, were broken.&nbsp; Cinders
&ldquo;were thrown out of the fire,&rdquo; and set some clothes in a
blaze.&nbsp; A globe leaped off a lamp.&nbsp; A farmer, Mr. Lea, saw
all the windows of the upper story &ldquo;as it were on fire,&rdquo;
but it was no such matter.&nbsp; The nurse-maid ran out in a fright,
to a neighbour&rsquo;s, and her dress spontaneously combusted as she
ran.&nbsp; The people attributed these and similar events, to something
in the coal, or in the air, or to electricity.&nbsp; When the nurse-girl,
Emma Davies, sat on the lap of the school mistress, Miss Maddox, her
boots kept flying off, like the boot laces in <i>The Daemon of Spraiton.</i></p>
<p>All this was printed in the London papers, and, on 15th November,
<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and <i>Daily News</i> published Emma&rsquo;s
confession that she wrought by sleight of hand and foot.&nbsp; On 17th
November, Mr. Hughes went from Cambridge to investigate.&nbsp; For some
reason investigation never begins till the fun is over.&nbsp; On the
9th the girl, now in a very nervous state (no wonder!) had been put
under the care of a Dr. Mackey.&nbsp; This gentleman and Miss Turner
said that things had occurred since Emma came, for which they could
not account.&nbsp; On 13th November, however, Miss Turner, looking out
of a window, spotted Emma throwing a brick, and pretending that the
flight of the brick was automatic.&nbsp; Next day Emma confessed to
her tricks, but steadfastly denied that she had cheated at Woods Farm,
and Weston Lullingfield, where she had also been.&nbsp; Her evidence
to this effect was so far confirmed by Mrs. Hampson of Woods Farm, and
her servant, Priscilla Evans, when examined by Mr. Hughes.&nbsp; Both
were &ldquo;quite certain&rdquo; that they saw crockery rise by itself
into air off the kitchen table, when Emma was at a neighbouring farm,
Mr. Lea&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Priscilla also saw crockery come out of a cupboard,
in detachments, and fly between her and Emma, usually in a slanting
direction, while Emma stood by with her arms folded.&nbsp; Yet Priscilla
was not on good terms with Emma.&nbsp; Unless, then, Mrs. Hampson and
Priscilla fabled, it is difficult to see how Emma could move objects
when she was &ldquo;standing at some considerable distance, standing,
in fact, in quite another farm&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Similar evidence was given and signed by Miss Maddox, the schoolmistress,
and Mr. and Mrs. Lea.&nbsp; On the other hand Mrs. Hampson and Priscilla
believed that Emma managed the fire-raising herself.&nbsp; The flames
were &ldquo;very high and white, and the articles were very little singed&rdquo;.&nbsp;
This occurred also at Rerrick, in 1696, but Mr. Hughes attributes it
to Emma&rsquo;s use of paraffin, which does not apply to the Rerrick
case.&nbsp; Paraffin smells a good deal&mdash;nothing is said about
a smell of paraffin.</p>
<p>Only one thing is certain: Emma was at last caught in a cheat.&nbsp;
This discredits her, but a man who cheats at cards <i>may</i> hold a
good hand by accident.&nbsp; In the same way, if such wonders can happen
(as so much world-wide evidence declares), they <i>may</i> have happened
at Woods Farm, and Emma, &ldquo;in a very nervous state,&rdquo; <i>may</i>
have feigned then, or rather did feign them later.</p>
<p>The question for the medical faculty is: Does a decided taste for
wilful fire-raising often accompany exhibitions of dancing furniture
and crockery, gratuitously given by patients of hysterical temperament?&nbsp;
This is quite a normal inquiry.&nbsp; Is there a nervous malady of which
the symptoms are domestic arson, and amateur <i>leger-de-main</i>?&nbsp;
The complaint, if it exists, is of very old standing and wide prevalence,
including Russia, Scotland, New England, France, Iceland, Germany, China
and Peru.</p>
<p>As a proof of the identity of symptoms in this malady, we give a
Chinese case.&nbsp; The Chinese, as to diabolical possession, are precisely
of the same opinion as the inspired authors of the Gospels.&nbsp; People
are &ldquo;possessed,&rdquo; and, like the woman having a spirit of
divination in the Acts of the Apostles, make a good thing out of it.&nbsp;
Thus Mrs. Ku was approached by a native Christian.&nbsp; She became
rigid and her demon, speaking through her, acknowledged the Catholic
verity, and said that if Mrs. Ku were converted he would have to leave.&nbsp;
On recovering her everyday consciousness, Mrs. Ku asked what Tsehwa,
her demon, had said.&nbsp; The Christian told her, and perhaps she would
have deserted her erroneous courses, but her fellow-villagers implored
her to pay homage to the demon.&nbsp; They were in the habit of resorting
to it for medical advice (as people do to Mrs. Piper&rsquo;s demon in
the United States), so Mrs. Ku decided to remain in the business. <a name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232">{232}</a>&nbsp;
The parallel to the case in the Acts is interesting.</p>
<h3>HAUNTED MRS. CHANG</h3>
<p>Mr. Chang, of that ilk (Chang Chang Tien-ts), was a man of fifty-seven,
and a graduate in letters.&nbsp; The ladies of his family having accommodated
a demon with a shrine in his house, Mr. Chang said he &ldquo;would have
none of that nonsense&rdquo;.&nbsp; The spirit then entered into Mrs.
Chang, and the usual fire-raising began all over the place.&nbsp; The
furniture and crockery danced in the familiar way, and objects took
to disappearing mysteriously, even when secured under lock and key.&nbsp;
Mr. Chang was as unlucky as Mr. Chin.&nbsp; At <i>his</i> house &ldquo;doors
would open of their own accord, footfalls were heard, as of persons
walking in the house, although no one could be seen.&nbsp; Plates, bowls
and the teapot would suddenly rise from the table into the air.&rdquo;
<a name="citation233a"></a><a href="#footnote233a">{233a}</a></p>
<p>Mrs. Chang now tried the off chance of there being something in Christianity,
stayed with a native Christian (the narrator), and felt much better.&nbsp;
She could enjoy her meals, and was quite a new woman.&nbsp; As her friend
could not go home with her, Mrs. Fung, a native Christian, resided for
a while at Mr. Chang&rsquo;s; &ldquo;comparative quiet was restored,&rdquo;
and Mrs. Fung retired to her family.</p>
<p>The symptoms returned; the native Christian was sent for, and found
Mr. Chang&rsquo;s establishment full of buckets of water for extinguishing
the sudden fires.&nbsp; Mrs. Chang&rsquo;s daughter-in-law was now possessed,
and &ldquo;drank wine in large quantities, though ordinarily she would
not touch it&rdquo;.&nbsp; She was staring and tossing her arms wildly;
a service was held, and she soon became her usual self.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, when the devils went out of the ladies, the fowls
flew into a state of wild excitement, while the swine rushed furiously
about and tried to climb a wall.</p>
<p>The family have become Christians, the fires have ceased; Mr. Chang
is an earnest inquirer, but opposed, for obvious reasons, to any public
profession of our religion. <a name="citation233b"></a><a href="#footnote233b">{233b}</a></p>
<p>In Mr. Niu&rsquo;s case &ldquo;strange noises and rappings were frequently
heard about the house.&nbsp; The buildings were also set on fire in
different places in some mysterious way.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Christians
tried to convert Mr. Niu, but as the devil now possessed his female
slave, whose success in fortune-telling was extremely lucrative, Mr.
Niu said that he preferred to leave well alone, and remained wedded
to his idols. <a name="citation234"></a><a href="#footnote234">{234}</a></p>
<p>We next offer a recent colonial case, in which the symptoms, as Mr.
Pecksniff said, were &ldquo;chronic&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>THE GREAT AMHERST MYSTERY</h3>
<p>On 13th February, 1888, Mr. Walter Hubbell, an actor by profession,
&ldquo;being duly sworn&rdquo; before a Notary Public in New York, testified
to the following story:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1879 he was acting with a strolling company, and came to Amherst,
in Nova Scotia.&nbsp; Here he heard of a haunted house, known to the
local newspapers as &ldquo;The Great Amherst Mystery&rdquo;.&nbsp; Having
previously succeeded in exposing the frauds of spiritualism Mr. Hubbell
determined to investigate the affair of Amherst.&nbsp; The haunted house
was inhabited by Daniel Teed, the respected foreman in a large shoe
factory.&nbsp; Under his roof were Mrs. Teed, &ldquo;as good a woman
as ever lived&rdquo;; little Willie, a baby boy; and Mrs. Teed&rsquo;s
two sisters, Jennie, a very pretty girl, and Esther, remarkable for
large grey eyes, pretty little hands and feet, and candour of expression.&nbsp;
A brother of Teed&rsquo;s and a brother of Mrs. Cox made up the family.&nbsp;
They were well off, and lived comfortably in a detached cottage of two
storys.&nbsp; It began when Jennie and Esther were in bed one night.&nbsp;
Esther jumped up, saying that there was a mouse in the bed.&nbsp; Next
night, a green band-box began to make a rustling noise, and then rose
a foot in the air, several times.&nbsp; On the following night Esther
felt unwell, and &ldquo;was a swelling wisibly before the werry eyes&rdquo;
of her alarmed family.&nbsp; Reports like thunder peeled through her
chamber, under a serene sky.&nbsp; Next day Esther could only eat &ldquo;a
small piece of bread and butter, and a large green pickle&rdquo;.&nbsp;
She recovered slightly, in spite of the pickle, but, four nights later,
all her and her sister&rsquo;s bed-clothes flew off, and settled down
in a remote corner.&nbsp; At Jennie&rsquo;s screams, the family rushed
in, and found Esther &ldquo;fearfully swollen&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mrs. Teed
replaced the bed-clothes, which flew off again, the pillow striking
John Teed in the face.&nbsp; Mr. Teed then left the room, observing,
in a somewhat unscientific spirit, that &ldquo;he had had enough of
it&rdquo;.&nbsp; The others, with a kindness which did them credit,
sat on the edges of the bed, and repressed the desire of the sheets
and blankets to fly away.&nbsp; The bed, however, sent forth peels like
thunder, when Esther suddenly fell into a peaceful sleep.</p>
<p>Next evening Dr. Carritte arrived, and the bolster flew at his head,
<i>and then went back again under Esther&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; While paralysed
by this phenomenon, unprecedented in his practice, the doctor heard
a metal point scribbling on the wall.&nbsp; Examining the place whence
the sound proceeded, he discovered this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Esther Cox!&nbsp; You are mine<br />
to kill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hubbell has verified the inscription, and often, later, recognised
the hand, in writings which &ldquo;came out of the air and fell at our
feet&rdquo;.&nbsp; Bits of plaster now gyrated in the room, accompanied
by peels of local thunder.&nbsp; The doctor admitted that his diagnosis
was at fault.&nbsp; Next day he visited his patient when potatoes flew
at him.&nbsp; He exhibited a powerful sedative, but pounding noises
began on the roofs and were audible at a distance of 200 yards, as the
doctor himself told Mr. Hubbell.</p>
<p>The clergy now investigated the circumstances, which they attributed
to electricity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even the most exclusive class&rdquo; frequented
Mr. Teed&rsquo;s house, till December, when Esther had an attack of
diphtheria.&nbsp; On recovering she went on to visit friends in Sackville,
New Brunswick, where nothing unusual occurred.&nbsp; On her return the
phenomena broke forth afresh, and Esther heard a voice proclaim that
the house would be set on fire.&nbsp; Lighted matches then fell from
the ceiling, but the family extinguished them.&nbsp; The ghost then
set a dress on fire, apparently as by spontaneous combustion, and this
kind of thing continued.&nbsp; The heads of the local fire-brigade suspected
Esther of these attempts at arson, and Dr. Nathan Tupper suggested that
she should be flogged.&nbsp; So Mr. Teed removed Esther to the house
of a Mr. White.</p>
<p>In about a month &ldquo;all,&rdquo; as Mrs. Nickleby&rsquo;s lover
said, &ldquo;was gas and gaiters&rdquo;.&nbsp; The furniture either
flew about, or broke into flames.&nbsp; Worse, certain pieces of iron
placed as an experiment on Esther&rsquo;s lap &ldquo;became too hot
to be handled with comfort,&rdquo; and then flew away.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubbell himself now came on the scene, and, not detecting imposture,
thought that &ldquo;there was money in it&rdquo;.&nbsp; He determined
to &ldquo;run&rdquo; Esther as a powerful attraction, he lecturing,
and Esther sitting on the platform.</p>
<p>It did not pay.&nbsp; The audience hurled things at Mr. Hubbell,
and these were the only volatile objects.&nbsp; Mr. Hubbell therefore
brought Esther back to her family at Amherst, where, in Esther&rsquo;s
absence, his umbrella and a large carving knife flew at him with every
appearance of malevolence.&nbsp; A great arm-chair next charged at him
like a bull, and to say that Mr. Hubbell was awed &ldquo;would indeed
seem an inadequate expression of my feelings&rdquo;.&nbsp; The ghosts
then thrice undressed little Willie in public, in derision of his tears
and outcries.&nbsp; Fire-raising followed, and that would be a hard
heart which could read the tale unmoved.&nbsp; Here it is, in the simple
eloquence of Mr. Hubbell:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was my first experience with Bob, the demon, as a fire-fiend;
and I say, candidly, that until I had had that experience I never fully
realised what an awful calamity it was to have an invisible monster,
somewhere within the atmosphere, going from place to place about the
house, gathering up old newspapers into a bundle and hiding it in the
basket of soiled linen or in a closet, then go and steal matches out
of the match-box in the kitchen or somebody&rsquo;s pocket, as he did
out of mine, and after kindling a fire in the bundle, tell Esther that
he had started a fire, but would not tell where; or perhaps not tell
her at all, in which case the first intimation we would have was the
smell of the smoke pouring through the house, and then the most intense
excitement, everybody running with buckets of water.&nbsp; I say it
was the most truly awful calamity that could possible befall any family,
infidel or Christian, that could be conceived in the mind of man or
ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much more terrible did it seem in this little cottage,
where all were strict members of church, prayed, sang hymns and read
the Bible.&nbsp; Poor Mrs. Teed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Mr. Hubbell&rsquo;s remarking that the cat was not tormented,
&ldquo;she was instantly lifted from the floor to a height of five feet,
and then dropped on Esther&rsquo;s back. . . .&nbsp; I never saw any
cat more frightened; she ran out into the front yard, where she remained
for the balance (rest) of the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; On 27th June &ldquo;a
trumpet was heard in the house all day&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Rev. R. A. Temple now prayed with Esther, and tried a little
amateur exorcism, including the use of slips of paper, inscribed with
Habakkuk ii. 3.&nbsp; The ghosts cared no more than Voltaire for <i>ce
coquin d&rsquo;Habacuc.</i></p>
<p>Things came to such a pass, matches simply raining all round, that
Mr. Teed&rsquo;s landlord, a Mr. Bliss, evicted Esther.&nbsp; She went
to a Mr. Van Amburgh&rsquo;s, and Mr. Teed&rsquo;s cottage was in peace.</p>
<p>Some weeks later Esther was arrested for incendiarism in a barn,
was sentenced to four months&rsquo; imprisonment, but was soon released
in deference to public opinion.&nbsp; She married, had a family; and
ceased to be a mystery.</p>
<p>This story is narrated with an amiable simplicity, and is backed,
more or less, by extracts from Amherst and other local newspapers.&nbsp;
On making inquiries, I found that opinion was divided.&nbsp; Some held
that Esther was a mere impostor and fire-raiser; from other sources
I obtained curious tales of the eccentric flight of objects in her neighbourhood.&nbsp;
It is only certain that Esther&rsquo;s case is identical with Madame
Shchapoff&rsquo;s, and experts in hysteria may tell us whether that
malady ever takes the form of setting fire to the patient&rsquo;s wardrobe,
and to things in general. <a name="citation239a"></a><a href="#footnote239a">{239a}</a></p>
<p>After these modern cases of disturbances, we may look at a few old,
or even ancient examples.&nbsp; It will be observed that the symptoms
are always of the same type, whatever the date or country.&nbsp; The
first is Gaelic, of last century.</p>
<h3>DONALD BAN AND THE BOCAN <a name="citation239b"></a><a href="#footnote239b">{239b}</a></h3>
<p>It is fully a hundred years ago since there died in Lochaber a man
named Donald Ban, sometimes called &ldquo;the son of Angus,&rdquo; but
more frequently known as Donald Ban of the Bocan.&nbsp; This surname
was derived from the troubles caused to him by a bocan&mdash;a goblin&mdash;many
of whose doings are preserved in tradition.</p>
<p>Donald drew his origin from the honourable house of Keppoch, and
was the last of the hunters of Macvic-Ronald.&nbsp; His home was at
Mounessee, and later at Inverlaire in Glenspean, and his wife belonged
to the MacGregors of Rannoch.&nbsp; He went out with the Prince, and
was present at the battle of Culloden.&nbsp; He fled from the field,
and took refuge in a mountain shieling, having two guns with him, but
only one of them was loaded.&nbsp; A company of soldiers came upon him
there, and although Donald escaped by a back window, taking the empty
gun with him by mistake, he was wounded in the leg by a shot from his
pursuers.&nbsp; The soldiers took him then, and conveyed him to Inverness,
where he was thrown into prison to await his trial.&nbsp; While he was
in prison he had a dream; he saw himself sitting and drinking with Alastair
MacCholla, and Donald MacRonald Vor.&nbsp; The latter was the man of
whom it was said that he had two hearts; he was taken prisoner at Falkirk
and executed at Carlisle.&nbsp; Donald was more fortunate than his friend,
and was finally set free.</p>
<p>It was after this that the bocan began to trouble him; and although
Donald never revealed to any man the secret of who the bocan was (if
indeed he knew it himself), yet there were some who professed to know
that it was a &ldquo;gillie&rdquo; of Donald&rsquo;s who was killed
at Culloden.&nbsp; Their reason for believing this was that on one occasion
the man in question had given away more to a poor neighbour than Donald
was pleased to spare.&nbsp; Donald found fault with him, and in the
quarrel that followed the man said, &ldquo;I will be avenged for this,
alive or dead&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was on the hill that Donald first met with the bocan, but he soon
came to closer quarters, and haunted the house in a most annoying fashion.&nbsp;
He injured the members of the household, and destroyed all the food,
being especially given to dirtying the butter (a thing quite superfluous,
according to Captain Burt&rsquo;s description of Highland butter).&nbsp;
On one occasion a certain Ronald of Aberardair was a guest in Donald&rsquo;s
house, and Donald&rsquo;s wife said, &ldquo;Though I put butter on the
table for you tonight, it will just be dirtied&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will go with you to the butter-keg,&rdquo; said Ronald, &ldquo;with
my dirk in my hand, and hold my bonnet over the keg, and he will not
dirty it this night.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the two went together to fetch
the butter, but it was dirtied just as usual.</p>
<p>Things were worse during the night and they could get no sleep for
the stones and clods that came flying about the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
bocan was throwing things out of the walls, and they would hear them
rattling at the head of Donald&rsquo;s bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The minister
came (Mr. John Mor MacDougall was his name) and slept a night or two
in the house, but the bocan kept away so long as he was there.&nbsp;
Another visitor, Angus MacAlister Ban, whose grandson told the tale,
had more experience of the bocan&rsquo;s reality.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something
seized his two big toes, and he could not get free any more than if
he had been caught by the smith&rsquo;s tongs.&nbsp; It was the bocan,
but he did nothing more to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the clergy, too,
as well as laymen of every rank, were witnesses to the pranks which
the spirit carried on, but not even Donald himself ever saw him in any
shape whatever.&nbsp; So famous did the affair become that Donald was
nearly ruined by entertaining all the curious strangers who came to
see the facts for themselves.</p>
<p>In the end Donald resolved to change his abode, to see whether he
could in that way escape from the visitations.&nbsp; He took all his
possessions with him except a harrow, which was left beside the wall
of the house, but before the party had gone far on the road the harrow
was seen coming after them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; said Donald;
&ldquo;if the harrow is coming after us, we may just as well go back
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mystery of the harrow is not explained, but
Donald did return to his home, and made no further attempt to escape
from his troubles in this way.</p>
<p>If the bocan had a spite at Donald, he was still worse disposed towards
his wife, the MacGregor woman.&nbsp; On the night on which he last made
his presence felt, he went on the roof of the house and cried, &ldquo;Are
you asleep, Donald Ban?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not just now,&rdquo; said
Donald.&nbsp; &ldquo;Put out that long grey tether, the MacGregor wife,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll do that tonight,&rdquo;
said Donald.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come out yourself, then,&rdquo; said the bocan,
&ldquo;and leave your bonnet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The good-wife, thinking that
the bocan was outside and would not hear her, whispered in Donald&rsquo;s
ear as he was rising, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you ask him when the Prince
will come?&rdquo;&nbsp; The words, however, were hardly out of her mouth
when the bocan answered her with, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get enough
of him before, you grey tether?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another account says that at this last visit of the bocan, he was
saying that various other spirits were along with him.&nbsp; Donald&rsquo;s
wife said to her husband: &ldquo;I should think that if they were along
with him they would speak to us&rdquo;; but the bocan answered, &ldquo;They
are no more able to speak than the sole of your foot&rdquo;.&nbsp; He
then summoned Donald outside as above.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo;
said Donald, &ldquo;and thanks be to the Good Being that you have asked
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Donald was taking his dirk with him as he went out,
but the bocan said, &ldquo;leave your dirk inside, Donald, and your
knife as well&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Donald then went outside, and the bocan led him on through rivers
and a birch-wood for about three miles, till they came to the river
Fert.&nbsp; There the bocan pointed out to Donald a hole in which he
had hidden some plough-irons while he was alive.&nbsp; Donald proceeded
to take them out, and while doing so the two eyes of the bocan were
causing him greater fear than anything else he ever heard or saw.&nbsp;
When he had got the irons out of the hole, they went back to Mounessie
together, and parted that night at the house of Donald Ban.</p>
<p>Donald, whether naturally or by reason of his ghostly visitant, was
a religious man, and commemorated his troubles in some verses which
bear the name of &ldquo;The Hymn of Donald Ban of the Bocan&rdquo;.&nbsp;
In these he speaks of the common belief that he had done something to
deserve all this annoyance, and makes mention of the &ldquo;stones and
clods&rdquo; which flew about his house in the night time.&nbsp; Otherwise
the hymn is mainly composed of religious sentiments, but its connection
with the story makes it interesting, and the following is a literal
translation of it.</p>
<h3>THE HYMN OF DONALD BAN</h3>
<blockquote><p>O God that created me so helpless,<br />
Strengthen my belief and make it firm.<br />
Command an angel to come from Paradise,<br />
And take up his abode in my dwelling,<br />
To protect me from every trouble<br />
That wicked folks are putting in my way;<br />
Jesus, that did&rsquo;st suffer Thy crucifixion,<br />
Restrain their doings, and be with me Thyself.</p>
<p>Little wonder though I am thoughtful&mdash;<br />
Always at the time when I go to bed<br />
The stones and the clods will arise&mdash;<br />
How could a saint get sleep there?<br />
I am without peace or rest,<br />
Without repose or sleep till the morning;<br />
O Thou that art in the throne of grace,<br />
Behold my treatment and be a guard to me.</p>
<p>Little wonder though I am troubled,<br />
So many stories about me in every place.<br />
Some that are unjust will be saying,<br />
&ldquo;It is all owing to himself, that affair&rdquo;.<br />
Judge not except as you know,<br />
Though the Son of God were awaking you;<br />
No one knows if I have deserved more<br />
Than a rich man that is without care.</p>
<p>Although I am in trouble at this time,<br />
Verily, I shall be doubly repaid;<br />
When the call comes to me from my Saviour,<br />
I shall receive mercy and new grace;<br />
I fear no more vexation,<br />
When I ascend to be with Thy saints;<br />
O Thou that sittest on the throne,<br />
Assist my speaking and accept my prayer.</p>
<p>O God, make me mindful<br />
Night and day to be praying,<br />
Seeking pardon richly<br />
For what I have done, on my knees.<br />
Stir with the spirit of Truth<br />
True repentance in my bosom,<br />
That when Thou sendest death to seek me,<br />
Christ may take care of me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bocan was not the only inhabitant of the spirit-world that Donald
Ban encountered during his lifetime.&nbsp; A cousin of his mother was
said to have been carried off by the fairies, and one night Donald saw
him among them, dancing away with all his might.&nbsp; Donald was also
out hunting in the year of the great snow, and at nightfall he saw a
man mounted on the back of a deer ascending a great rock.&nbsp; He heard
the man saying, &ldquo;Home, Donald Ban,&rdquo; and fortunately he took
the advice, for that night there fell eleven feet of snow in the very
spot where he had intended to stay.</p>
<p>We now take two modern Icelandic cases, for the purpose of leading
up to the famous Icelandic legend of Grettir and Glam the Vampire, from
the Grettis Saga.&nbsp; It is plain that such incidents as those in
the two modern Icelandic cases (however the effects were produced) might
easily be swollen into the prodigious tale of Glam in the course of
two or three centuries, between Grettir&rsquo;s time and the complete
formation of his Saga.</p>
<h3>THE DEVIL OF HJALTA-STAD <a name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246">{246}</a></h3>
<p>The sheriff writes: &ldquo;The Devil at Hjalta-stad was outspoken
enough this past winter, although no one saw him.&nbsp; I, along with
others, had the dishonour to hear him talking for nearly two days, during
which he addressed myself and the minister, Sir Grim, with words the
like of which &lsquo;eye hath not seen nor ear heard&rsquo;.&nbsp; As
soon as we reached the front of the house there was heard in the door
an iron voice saying:&nbsp; &lsquo;So Hans from Eyrar is come now, and
wishes to talk with me, the --- idiot&rsquo;.&nbsp; Compared with other
names that he gave me this might be considered as flattering.&nbsp;
When I inquired who it was that addressed me with such words, he answered
in a fierce voice, &lsquo;I was called Lucifer at first, but now I am
called Devil and Enemy&rsquo;.&nbsp; He threw at us both stones and
pieces of wood, as well as other things, and broke two windows in the
minister&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; He spoke so close to us that he seemed
to be just at our side.&nbsp; There was an old woman there of the name
of Opia, whom he called his wife, and a &lsquo;heavenly blessed soul,&rsquo;
and asked Sir Grim to marry them, with various other remarks of this
kind, which I will not recount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have little liking to write about his ongoings, which were
all disgraceful and shameful, in accordance with the nature of the actor.&nbsp;
He repeated the &lsquo;Pater Noster&rsquo; three times, answered questions
from the Catechism and the Bible, said that the devils held service
in hell, and told what texts and psalms they had for various occasions.&nbsp;
He asked us to give him some of the food we had, and a drink of tea,
etc.&nbsp; I asked the fellow whether God was good.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Whether he was truthful.&nbsp; He answered, &lsquo;Not one of his words
can be doubted&rsquo;.&nbsp; Sir Grim asked him whether the devil was
good-looking.&nbsp; He answered: &lsquo;He is far better-looking than
you, you --- ugly snout!&rsquo;&nbsp; I asked him whether the devils
agreed well with each other.&nbsp; He answered in a kind of sobbing
voice: &lsquo;It is painful to know that they never have peace&rsquo;.&nbsp;
I bade him say something to me in German, and said to him <i>Lass uns
Teusc redre</i> (<i>sic</i>), but he answered as if he had misunderstood
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we went to bed in the evening he shouted fiercely in
the middle of the floor, &lsquo;On this night I shall snatch you off
to hell, and you shall not rise up out of bed as you lay down&rsquo;.&nbsp;
During the evening he wished the minister&rsquo;s wife good-night.&nbsp;
The minister and I continued to talk with him during the night; among
other things we asked him what kind of weather it was outside.&nbsp;
He answered: &lsquo;It is cold, with a north wind&rsquo;.&nbsp; We asked
if he was cold.&nbsp; He answered: &lsquo;I think I am both hot and
cold&rsquo;.&nbsp; I asked him how loud he could shout.&nbsp; He said,
&lsquo;So loud that the roof would go off the house, and you would all
fall into a dead faint&rsquo;.&nbsp; I told him to try it.&nbsp; He
answered: &lsquo;Do you think I am come to amuse you, you --- idiot?&rsquo;&nbsp;
I asked him to show us a little specimen.&nbsp; He said he would do
so, and gave three shouts, the last of which was so fearful that I have
never heard anything worse, and doubt whether I ever shall.&nbsp; Towards
daybreak, after he had parted from us with the usual compliments, we
fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning he came in again, and began to waken up people;
he named each one by name, not forgetting to add some nickname, and
asking whether so-and-so was awake.&nbsp; When he saw they were all
awake, he said he was going to play with the door now, and with that
he threw the door off its hinges with a sudden jerk, and sent it far
in upon the floor.&nbsp; The strangest thing was that when he threw
anything it went down at once, and then went back to its place again,
so it was evident that he either went inside it or moved about with
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The previous evening he challenged me twice to come out into
the darkness to him, and this in an angry voice, saying that he would
tear me limb from limb.&nbsp; I went out and told him to come on, but
nothing happened.&nbsp; When I went back to my place and asked him why
he had not fulfilled his promise, he said, &lsquo;I had no orders for
it from my master&rsquo;.&nbsp; He asked us whether we had ever heard
the like before, and when we said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;That
is not true: the like has never been heard at any time&rsquo;.&nbsp;
He had sung &lsquo;The memory of Jesus&rsquo; after I arrived there,
and talked frequently while the word of God was being read.&nbsp; He
said that he did not mind this, but that he did not like the &lsquo;Cross-school
Psalms,&rsquo; and said it must have been a great idiot who composed
them.&nbsp; This enemy came like a devil, departed as such, and behaved
himself as such while he was present, nor would it befit any one but
the devil to declare all that he said.&nbsp; At the same time it must
be added that I am not quite convinced that it was a spirit, but my
opinions on this I cannot give here for lack of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another work <a name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249">{249}</a>
where the sheriff&rsquo;s letter is given with some variations and additions,
an attempt is made to explain the story.&nbsp; The phenomena were said
to have been caused by a young man who had learned ventriloquism abroad.&nbsp;
Even if this art could have been practised so successfully as to puzzle
the sheriff and others, it could hardly have taken the door off its
hinges and thrown it into the room.&nbsp; It is curious that while Jon
Espolin in his <i>Annals</i> entirely discredits the sheriff&rsquo;s
letter, he yet gives a very similar account of the spirit&rsquo;s proceedings.</p>
<p>A later story of the same kind, also printed by Jon Arnason (i.,
311), is that of the ghost at Garpsdal as related by the minister there,
Sir Saemund, and written down by another minister on 7th June, 1808.&nbsp;
The narrative is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE GHOST AT GARPSDAL</h3>
<p>In Autumn, 1807, there was a disturbance by night in the outer room
at Garpsdal, the door being smashed.&nbsp; There slept in this room
the minister&rsquo;s men-servants, Thorsteinn Gudmundsson, Magnus Jonsson,
and a child named Thorstein.&nbsp; Later, on 16th November, a boat which
the minister had lying at the sea-side was broken in broad daylight,
and although the blows were heard at the homestead yet no human form
was visible that could have done this.&nbsp; All the folks at Garpsdal
were at home, and the young fellow Magnus Jonsson was engaged either
at the sheep-houses or about the homestead; the spirit often appeared
to him in the likeness of a woman.&nbsp; On the 18th of the same month
four doors of the sheep-houses were broken in broad daylight, while
the minister was marrying a couple in the church; most of his people
were present in the church, Magnus being among them.&nbsp; That same
day in the evening this woman was noticed in the sheep-houses; she said
that she wished to get a ewe to roast, but as soon as an old woman who
lived at Garpsdal and was both skilled and wise (Gudrun Jons-dottir
by name) had handled the ewe, its struggles ceased and it recovered
again.&nbsp; While Gudrun was handling the ewe, Magnus was standing
in the door of the house; with that one of the rafters was broken, and
the pieces were thrown in his face.&nbsp; He said that the woman went
away just then.&nbsp; The minister&rsquo;s horses were close by, and
at that moment became so scared that they ran straight over smooth ice
as though it had been earth, and suffered no harm.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 20th there were great disturbances, panelling
and doors being broken down in various rooms.&nbsp; The minister was
standing in the house door along with Magnus and two or three girls
when Magnus said to him that the spirit had gone into the sitting-room.&nbsp;
The minister went and stood at the door of the room, and after he had
been there a little while, talking to the others, a pane of glass in
one of the room windows was broken.&nbsp; Magnus was standing beside
the minister talking to him, and when the pane broke he said that the
spirit had gone out by that.&nbsp; The minister went to the window,
and saw that the pane was all broken into little pieces.&nbsp; The following
evening, the 21st, the spirit also made its presence known by bangings,
thumpings, and loud noises.</p>
<p>On the 28th the ongoings of the spirit surpassed themselves.&nbsp;
In the evening a great blow was given on the roof of the sitting-room.&nbsp;
The minister was inside at the time, but Magnus with two girls was out
in the barn.&nbsp; At the same moment the partition between the weaving-shop
and the sitting-room was broken down, and then three windows of the
room itself&mdash;one above the minister&rsquo;s bed, another above
his writing-table, and the third in front of the closet door.&nbsp;
A piece of a table was thrown in at one of these, and a spade at another.&nbsp;
At this the household ran out of that room into the loft, but the minister
sprang downstairs and out; the old woman Gudrun who was named before
went with him, and there also came Magnus and some of the others.&nbsp;
Just then a vessel of wash, which had been standing in the kitchen,
was thrown at Gudrun&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The minister then ran in, along
with Magnus and the girls, and now everything that was loose was flying
about, both doors and splinters of wood.&nbsp; The minister opened a
room near the outer door intending to go in there, but just then a sledge
hammer which lay at the door was thrown at him, but it only touched
him on the side and hip, and did him no harm.&nbsp; From there the minister
and the others went back to the sitting-room, where everything was dancing
about, and where they were met with a perfect volley of splinters of
deal from the partitions.&nbsp; The minister then fled, and took his
wife and child to Muli, the next farm, and left them there, as she was
frightened to death with all this.&nbsp; He himself returned next day.</p>
<p>On the 8th of December, the woman again made her appearance in broad
daylight.&nbsp; On this occasion she broke the shelves and panelling
in the pantry, in presence of the minister, Magnus, and others.&nbsp;
According to Magnus, the spirit then went out through the wall at the
minister&rsquo;s words, and made its way to the byre-lane.&nbsp; Magnus
and Gudrun went after it, but were received with throwings of mud and
dirt.&nbsp; A stone was also hurled at Magnus, as large as any man could
lift, while Gudrun received a blow on the arm that confined her to her
bed for three weeks.</p>
<p>On the 26th of the month the shepherd, Einar Jonsson, a hardy and
resolute fellow, commanded the spirit to show itself to him.&nbsp; Thereupon
there came over him such a madness and frenzy, that he had to be closely
guarded to prevent him from doing harm to himself.&nbsp; He was taken
to the house, and kept in his bed, a watch being held over him.&nbsp;
When he recovered his wits, he said that this girl had come above his
head and assailed him.&nbsp; When he had completely got over this, he
went away from Garpsdal altogether.</p>
<p>Later than this the minister&rsquo;s horse was found dead in the
stable at Muli, and the folks there said that it was all black and swollen.</p>
<p>These are the most remarkable doings of the ghost at Garpsdal, according
to the evidence of Sir Saemund, Magnus, Gudrun, and all the household
at Garpsdal, all of whom will confirm their witness with an oath, and
aver that no human being could have been so invisible there by day and
night, but rather that it was some kind of spirit that did the mischief.&nbsp;
From the story itself it may be seen that neither Magnus nor any other
person could have accomplished the like, and all the folk will confirm
this, and clear all persons in the matter, so far as they know.&nbsp;
In this form the story was told to me, the subscriber, to Samuel Egilsson
and Bjarni Oddsson, by the minister himself and his household, at Garpsdal,
28th May, 1808.&nbsp; That this is correctly set down, after what the
minister Sir Saemund related to me, I witness here at Stad on Reykjanes,
7th June, 1808.</p>
<p>GISLI OLAFSSON</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this declaration, the troubles at Garpsdal were attributed
by others to Magnus, and the name of the &ldquo;Garpsdale Ghost&rdquo;
stuck to him throughout his life.&nbsp; He was alive in 1862, when Jon
Arnason&rsquo;s volume was published.</p>
<p>These modern instances lead up to &ldquo;the best story in the world,&rdquo;
the old Icelandic tale of Glam.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
The Story of Glam.&nbsp; The Foul Fords.</h2>
<h3>THE STORY OF GLAM</h3>
<p>There was a man named Thorhall, who lived at Thorhall-stead in Forsaela-dala,
which lies in the north of Iceland.&nbsp; He was a fairly wealthy man,
especially in cattle, so that no one round about had so much live-stock
as he had.&nbsp; He was not a chief, however, but an honest and worthy
yeoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this man&rsquo;s place was greatly haunted, so that he
could scarcely get a shepherd to stay with him, and although he asked
the opinion of many as to what he ought to do, he could find none to
give him advice of any worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One summer at the Althing, or yearly assembly of the people,
Thorhall went to the booth of Skafti, the law man, who was the wisest
of men and gave good counsel when his opinion was asked.&nbsp; He received
Thorhall in a friendly way, because he knew he was a man of means, and
asked him what news he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would have some good advice from you,&rsquo; said
Thorhall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am little able to give that,&rsquo; said Skafti;
&lsquo;but what is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the way of it,&rsquo; said Thorhall, &lsquo;I
have had very bad luck with my shepherds of late.&nbsp; Some of them
get injured, and others will not serve out their time; and now no one
that knows how the case stands will take the place at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then there must be some evil spirit there,&rsquo; said
Skafti, &lsquo;when men are less willing to herd your sheep, than those
of others.&nbsp; Now since you have asked my advice, I will get a shepherd
for you.&nbsp; Glam is his name, he belongs to Sweden, and came out
here last summer.&nbsp; He is big and strong, but not very well liked
by most people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorhall said that he did not mind that, if he looked well
after the sheep.&nbsp; Skafti answered that there was no hope of other
men doing it, if Glam could not, seeing he was so strong and stout-hearted.&nbsp;
Their talk ended there, and Thorhall left the booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This took place just at the breaking up of the assembly.&nbsp;
Thorhall missed two of his horses, and went to look for them in person,
from which it may be seen that he was no proud man.&nbsp; He went up
to the mountain ridge, and south along the fell that is called Armann&rsquo;s
fell.&nbsp; There he saw a man coming down from the wood, leading a
horse laden with bundles of brushwood.&nbsp; They soon met each other
and Thorhall asked his name.&nbsp; He said he was called Glam.&nbsp;
He was tall of body, and of strange appearance; his eyes were blue and
staring, and his hair wolf-grey in colour.&nbsp; Thorhall was a little
startled when he saw him, and was certain that this was the man he had
been told about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What work are you best fitted for?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp;
Glam said that he was good at keeping sheep in winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you look after <i>my</i> sheep?&rsquo; said Thorhall.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Skafti has put you into my hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On this condition only will I take service with you,&rsquo;
said Glam, &lsquo;that I have my own free will, for I am ill-tempered
if anything does not please me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That will not harm me,&rsquo; said Thorhall, &lsquo;and
I should like you to come to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will do so,&rsquo; said Glam; &lsquo;but is there
any trouble at your place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is believed to be haunted,&rsquo; said Thorhall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am not afraid of such bug-bears,&rsquo; said Glam,
&lsquo;and think that it will be all the livelier for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will need all your boldness,&rsquo; said Thorhall,
&lsquo;It is best not to be too frightened for one&rsquo;s self there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this they made a bargain between them, and Glam was
to come when the winter nights began.&nbsp; Then they parted, and Thorhall
found his horses where he had just newly looked for them, and rode home,
after thanking Skafti for his kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summer passed, and Thorhall heard nothing of the shepherd,
nor did any one know the least about him, but at the time appointed
he came to Thorhall-stead.&nbsp; The yeoman received him well, but the
others did not like him, and the good-wife least of all.&nbsp; He began
his work among the sheep which gave him little trouble, for he had a
loud, hoarse voice, and the flock all ran together whenever he shouted.&nbsp;
There was a church at Thorhall-stead, but Glam would never go to it
nor join in the service.&nbsp; He was unbelieving, surly, and difficult
to deal with, and ever one felt a dislike towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So time went on till it came to Christmas eve.&nbsp; On that
morning Glam rose early and called for his food.&nbsp; The good-wife
answered: &lsquo;It is not the custom of Christian people to eat on
this day, for to-morrow is the first day of Christmas, and we ought
to fast to-day&rsquo;.&nbsp; Glam replied: &lsquo;You have many foolish
fashions that I see no good in.&nbsp; I cannot see that men are any
better off now than they were when they never troubled themselves about
such things.&nbsp; I think it was a far better life when men were heathens;
and now I want my food, and no nonsense.&rsquo;&nbsp; The good-wife
answered: &lsquo;I am sure you will come to sorrow to-day if you act
thus perversely&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glam bade her bring his food at once, or it would be the worse
for her.&nbsp; She was afraid to refuse, and after he had eaten he went
out in a great rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weather was very bad.&nbsp; It was dark and gloomy all
round; snowflakes fluttered about; loud noises were heard in the air,
and it grew worse and worse as the day wore on.&nbsp; They heard the
shepherd&rsquo;s voice during the forenoon, but less of him as the day
passed.&nbsp; Then the snow began to drift, and by evening there was
a violent storm.&nbsp; People came to the service in church, and the
day wore on to evening, but still Glam did not come home.&nbsp; There
was some talk among them of going to look for him, but no search was
made on account of the storm and the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Christmas eve Glam did not return, and in the morning
men went to look for him.&nbsp; They found the sheep scattered in the
fens, beaten down by the storm, or up on the hills.&nbsp; Thereafter
they came to a place in the valley where the snow was all trampled,
as if there had been a terrible struggle there, for stones and frozen
earth were torn up all round about.&nbsp; They looked carefully round
the place, and found Glam lying a short distance off, quite dead.&nbsp;
He was black in colour, and swollen up as big as an ox.&nbsp; They were
horrified at the sight, and shuddered in their hearts.&nbsp; However,
they tried to carry him to the church, but could get him no further
than to the edge of a cleft, a little lower down; so they left him there
and went home and told their master what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorhall asked them what had been the cause of Glam&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; They said that they had traced footprints as large as though
the bottom of a cask had been set down in the snow leading from where
the trampled place was up to the cliffs at the head of the valley, and
all along the track there were huge blood-stains.&nbsp; From this they
guessed that the evil spirit which lived there must have killed Glam,
but had received so much hurt that it had died, for nothing was ever
seen of it after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second day of Christmas they tried again to bring Glam
to the church.&nbsp; They yoked horses to him, but after they had come
down the slope and reached level ground they could drag him no further,
and he had to be left there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the third day a priest went with them, but Glam was not
be found, although they searched for him all day.&nbsp; The priest refused
to go a second time, and the shepherd was found at once when the priest
was not present.&nbsp; So they gave over their attempts to take him
to the church, and buried him on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after this they became aware that Glam was not lying
quiet, and great damage was done by him, for many that saw him fell
into a swoon, or lost their reason.&nbsp; Immediately after Yule men
believed that they saw him about the farm itself, and grew terribly
frightened, so that many of them ran away.&nbsp; After this Glam began
to ride on the house-top by night, <a name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259">{259}</a>
and nearly shook it to pieces, and then he walked about almost night
and day.&nbsp; Men hardly dared to go up into the valley, even although
they had urgent business there, and every one in the district thought
great harm of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spring, Thorhall got new men, and started the farm again,
while Glam&rsquo;s walkings began to grow less frequent as the days
grew longer.&nbsp; So time went on, until it was mid-summer.&nbsp; That
summer a ship from Norway came into Huna-water (a firth to the north
of Thorhall-stead), and had on board a man called Thorgaut.&nbsp; He
was foreign by birth, big of body, and as strong as any two men.&nbsp;
He was unhired and unmarried, and was looking for some employment, as
he was penniless.&nbsp; Thorhall rode to the ship, and found Thorgaut
there.&nbsp; He asked him whether he would enter his service.&nbsp;
Thorgaut answered that he might well do so, and that he did not care
much what work he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must know, however,&rsquo; said Thorhall, &lsquo;that
it is not good for any faint-hearted man to live at my place, on account
of the hauntings that have been of late, and I do not wish to deceive
you in any way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not think myself utterly lost although I see some
wretched ghosts,&rsquo; said Thorgaut.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will be no light
matter for others if <i>I</i> am scared, and I will not throw up the
place on that account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their bargain was quickly made, and Thorgaut was to have charge
of the sheep during the winter.&nbsp; The summer went past, and Thorgaut
began his duties with the winter nights, and was well liked by every
one.&nbsp; Glam began to come again, and rode on the house-top, which
Thorgaut thought great sport, and said that the thrall would have to
come to close quarters before he would be afraid of him.&nbsp; Thorhall
bade him not say too much about it.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will be better for
you,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if you have no trial of each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your courage has indeed been shaken out of you,&rsquo;
said Thorgaut, &lsquo;but I am not going to fall dead for such talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The winter went on till Christmas came again, and on Christmas
eve the shepherd went out to his sheep.&nbsp; &lsquo;I trust,&rsquo;
said the good-wife, &lsquo;that things will not go after the old fashion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have no fear of that, good-wife,&rsquo; said Thorgaut;
&lsquo;there will be something worth talking about if I don&rsquo;t
come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weather was very cold, and a heavy drift blowing.&nbsp;
Thorgaut was in the habit of coming home when it was half-dark, but
on this occasion he did not return at his usual time.&nbsp; People came
to church, and they now began to think that things were not unlikely
to fall out as they had done before.&nbsp; Thorhall wished to make search
for the shepherd, but the church-goers refused, saying that they would
not risk themselves in the hands of evil demons by night, and so no
search was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After their morning meal on Christmas day they went out to
look for the shepherd.&nbsp; They first made their way to Glam&rsquo;s
cairn, guessing that he was the cause of the man&rsquo;s disappearance.&nbsp;
On coming near to this they saw great tidings, for there they found
the shepherd with his neck broken and every bone in his body smashed
in pieces.&nbsp; They carried him to the church, and he did no harm
to any man thereafter.&nbsp; But Glam began to gather strength anew,
and now went so far in his mischief that every one fled from Thorhall-stead,
except the yeoman and his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same cattleman, however, had been there for a long time,
and Thorhall would not let him leave, because he was so faithful and
so careful.&nbsp; He was very old, and did not want to go away either,
for he saw that everything his master had would go to wreck and ruin,
if there was no one to look after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning after the middle of winter the good-wife went
out to the byre to milk the cows.&nbsp; It was broad daylight by this
time, for no one ventured to be outside earlier than that, except the
cattleman, who always went out when it began to grow clear.&nbsp; She
heard a great noise and fearful bellowing in the byre, and ran into
the house again, crying out and saying that some awful thing was going
on there.&nbsp; Thorhall went out to the cattle and found them goring
each other with their horns.&nbsp; To get out of their way, he went
through into the barn, and in doing this he saw the cattleman lying
on his back with his head in one stall and his feet in another.&nbsp;
He went up to him and felt him and soon found that he was dead, with
his back broken over the upright stone between two of the stalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yeoman thought it high time to leave the place now, and
fled from his farm with all that he could remove.&nbsp; All the live-stock
that he left behind was killed by Glam, who then went through the whole
glen and laid waste all the farms up from Tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorhall spent the rest of the winter with various friends.&nbsp;
No one could go up into the glen with horse or dog, for these were killed
at once; but when spring came again and the days began to lengthen,
Glam&rsquo;s walkings grew less frequent, and Thorhall determined to
return to his homestead.&nbsp; He had difficulty in getting servants,
but managed to set up his home again at Thorhall-stead.&nbsp; Things
went just as before.&nbsp; When autumn came, the hauntings began again,
and now it was the yeoman&rsquo;s daughter who was most assailed, till
in the end she died of fright.&nbsp; Many plans were tried, but all
to no effect, and it seemed as if all Water-dale would be laid waste
unless some remedy could be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this befell in the days of Grettir, the son of Asmund,
who was the strongest man of his day in Iceland.&nbsp; He had been abroad
at this time, outlawed for three years, and was only eighteen years
of age when he returned.&nbsp; He had been at home all through the autumn,
but when the winter nights were well advanced, he rode north to Water-dale,
and came to Tongue, where lived his uncle J&ouml;kull.&nbsp; His uncle
received him heartily, and he stayed there for three nights.&nbsp; At
this time there was so much talk about Glam&rsquo;s walkings, that nothing
was so largely spoken of as these.&nbsp; Grettir inquired closely about
all that had happened, and J&ouml;kull said that the stories told no
more than had indeed taken place; &lsquo;but are you intending to go
there, kinsman?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; Grettir answered that he was.&nbsp;
J&ouml;kull bade him not do so, &lsquo;for it is a dangerous undertaking,
and a great risk for your friends to lose you, for in our opinion there
is not another like you among the young men, and &ldquo;ill will come
of ill&rdquo; where Glam is.&nbsp; Far better it is to deal with mortal
men than with such evil spirits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grettir, however, said that he had a mind to fare to Thorhall-stead,
and see how things had been going on there.&nbsp; J&ouml;kull replied:
&lsquo;I see now that it is of no use to hold you back, but the saying
is true that &ldquo;good luck and good heart are not the same&rsquo;&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Grettir answered: &lsquo;&ldquo;Woe stands at one man&rsquo;s door when
it has entered another&rsquo;s house&rdquo;.&nbsp; Think how it may
go with yourself before the end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It may be,&rsquo; said J&ouml;kull, &lsquo;that both
of us see some way into the future, and yet neither of us can do anything
to prevent it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this they parted, and neither liked the other&rsquo;s
forebodings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grettir rode to Thorhall-stead, and the yeoman received him
heartily.&nbsp; He asked Grettir where he was going, who said that he
wished to stay there all night if he would allow him.&nbsp; Thorhall
said that he would be very glad if he would stay, &lsquo;but few men
count it a gain to be guests here for long.&nbsp; You must have heard
how matters stand, and I shall be very unwilling for you to come to
any harm on my account.&nbsp; And even although you yourself escape
safe and sound, I know for certain that you will lose your horse, for
no man that comes here can keep that uninjured.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grettir answered that there were horses enough to be got,
whatever might happen to this one.&nbsp; Thorhall was delighted that
he was willing to stay, and gave him the heartiest reception.&nbsp;
The horse was strongly secured in an out-house; then they went to sleep,
and that night passed without Glam appearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your coming here,&rsquo; said Thorhall, &lsquo;has
made a happy change, for Glam is in the habit of riding the house every
night, or breaking up the doors, as you may see for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then one of two things will happen,&rsquo; said Grettir;
&lsquo;either he will not restrain himself for long, or the hauntings
will cease for more than one night.&nbsp; I shall stay for another night,
and see how things go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this they went to look at Grettir&rsquo;s horse, and
found that he had not been meddled with, so the yeoman thought that
everything was going on well, Grettir stayed another night, and still
the thrall did not come about them.&nbsp; Thorhall thought that things
were looking brighter, but when he went to look to Grettir&rsquo;s horse
he found the out-house broken up, the horse dragged outside, and every
bone in it broken.&nbsp; He told Grettir what had happened, and advised
him to secure his own safety, &lsquo;for your death is certain if you
wait for Glam&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grettir answered: &lsquo;The least I can get for my horse
is to see the thrall&rsquo;.&nbsp; Thorhall replied that it would do
him no good to see him, &lsquo;for he is unlike anything in human shape;
but I am fain of every hour that you are willing to stay here&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day wore on, and when it was bed-time Grettir would not
take off his clothes, but lay down on the floor over against Thorhall&rsquo;s
bed-closet.&nbsp; He put a thick cloak above himself, buttoning one
end beneath his feet, and doubling the other under his head, while he
looked out at the hole for the neck.&nbsp; There was a strong plank
in front of the floored space, and against this he pressed his feet.&nbsp;
The door-fittings were all broken off from the outer door, but there
was a hurdle set up instead, and roughly secured.&nbsp; The wainscot
that had once stretched across the hall was all broken down, both above
and below the cross-beam.&nbsp; The beds were all pulled out of their
places, and everything was in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light was left burning in the hall, and when the third part
of the night was past Grettir heard loud noises outside.&nbsp; Then
something went up on top of the house, and rode above the hall, beating
the roof with its heels till every beam cracked.&nbsp; This went on
for a long time; then it came down off the house and went to the door.&nbsp;
When this was opened Grettir saw the thrall thrust in his head; ghastly
big he seemed, and wonderfully huge of feature.&nbsp; Glam came in slowly,
and raised himself up when he was inside the doorway, till he loomed
up against the roof.&nbsp; Then he turned his face down the hall, laid
his arms on the cross-beam, and glared all over the place.&nbsp; Thorhall
gave no sign during all this, for he thought it bad enough to hear what
was going on outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grettir lay still and never moved.&nbsp; Glam saw that there
was a bundle lying on the floor, and moved further up the hall and grasped
the cloak firmly.&nbsp; Grettir placed his feet against the plank, and
yielded not the least.&nbsp; Glam tugged a second time, much harder
than before, but still the cloak did not move.&nbsp; A third time he
pulled with both his hands, so hard that he raised Grettir up from the
floor, and now they wrenched the cloak asunder between them.&nbsp; Glam
stood staring at the piece which he held in his hands, and wondering
greatly who could have pulled so hard against him.&nbsp; At that moment
Grettir sprang in under the monster&rsquo;s hands, and threw his arms
around his waist, intending to make him fall backwards.&nbsp; Glam,
however, bore down upon him so strongly that Grettir was forced to give
way before him.&nbsp; He then tried to stay himself against the seat-boards,
but these gave way with him, and everything that came in their path
was broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glam wanted to get him outside, and although Grettir set his
feet against everything that he could, yet Glam succeeded in dragging
him out into the porch.&nbsp; There they had a fierce struggle, for
the thrall meant to have him out of doors, while Grettir saw that bad
as it was to deal with Glam inside the house it would be worse outside,
and therefore strove with all his might against being carried out.&nbsp;
When they came into the porch Glam put forth all his strength, and pulled
Grettir close to him.&nbsp; When Grettir saw that he could not stay
himself he suddenly changed his plan, and threw himself as hard as he
could against the monster&rsquo;s breast, setting both his feet against
an earth-fast stone that lay in the doorway.&nbsp; Glam was not prepared
for this, being then in the act of pulling Grettir towards him, so he
fell backwards and went crashing out through the door, his shoulders
catching the lintel as he fell.&nbsp; The roof of the porch was wrenched
in two, both rafters and frozen thatch, and backwards out of the house
went Glam, with Grettir above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside there was bright moonshine and broken clouds, which
sometimes drifted over the moon and sometimes left it clear.&nbsp; At
the moment when Glam fell the cloud passed off the moon, and he cast
up his eyes sharply towards it; and Grettir himself said that this was
the only sight he ever saw that terrified him.&nbsp; Then Grettir grew
so helpless, both by reason of his weariness and at seeing Glam roll
his eyes so horribly, that he was unable to draw his dagger, and lay
well-nigh between life and death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in this was Glam&rsquo;s might more fiendish than that
of most other ghosts, that he spoke in this fashion: &lsquo;Great eagerness
have you shown to meet me, Grettir, and little wonder will it be though
you get no great good fortune from me; but this I may tell you, that
you have now received only half of the strength and vigour that was
destined for you if you had not met with me.&nbsp; I cannot now take
from you the strength you have already gained, but this I can see to,
that you will never be stronger than you are now, and yet you are strong
enough, as many a man shall feel.&nbsp; Hitherto you have been famous
for your deeds, but henceforth you shall be a manslayer and an outlaw,
and most of your deeds will turn to your own hurt and misfortune.&nbsp;
Outlawed you shall be, and ever have a solitary life for your lot; and
this, too, I lay upon you, ever to see these eyes of mine before your
own, and then you will think it hard to be alone, and that will bring
you to your death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Glam had said this the faintness passed off Grettir,
and he then drew his dagger, cut off Glam&rsquo;s head, and laid it
beside his thigh.&nbsp; Thorhall then came out, having put on his clothes
while Glam was talking, but never venturing to come near until he had
fallen.&nbsp; He praised God, and thanked Grettir for overcoming the
unclean spirit.&nbsp; Then they set to work, and burned Glam to ashes,
which they placed in a sack, and buried where cattle were least likely
to pasture or men to tread.&nbsp; When this was done they went home
again, and it was now near daybreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorhall sent to the next farm for the men there, and told
them what had taken place.&nbsp; All thought highly of the exploit that
heard of it, and it was the common talk that in all Iceland there was
no man like Grettir Asnundarson for strength and courage and all kinds
of bodily feats.&nbsp; Thorhall gave him a good horse when he went away,
as well as a fine suit of clothes, for the ones he had been wearing
were all torn to pieces.&nbsp; The two then parted with the utmost friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thence Grettir rode to the Ridge in Water-dale, where his
kinsman Thorvald received him heartily, and asked closely concerning
his encounter with Glam.&nbsp; Grettir told him how he had fared, and
said that his strength was never put to harder proof, so long did the
struggle between them last.&nbsp; Thorvald bade him be quiet and gentle
in his conduct, and things would go well with him, otherwise his troubles
would be many.&nbsp; Grettir answered that his temper was not improved;
he was more easily roused than ever, and less able to bear opposition.&nbsp;
In this, too, he felt a great change, that he had become so much afraid
of the dark that he dared not go anywhere alone after night began to
fall, for then he saw phantoms and monsters of every kind.&nbsp; So
it has become a saying ever since then, when folk see things very different
from what they are, that Glam lends them his eyes, or gives them glam-sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fear of solitude brought Grettir, at last, to his end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghosts being seldom dangerous to human life, we follow up the homicidal
Glam with a Scottish traditional story of malevolent and murderous sprites.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;THE FOUL FORDS&rsquo; OR THE LONGFORMACUS FARRIER</h3>
<p>&ldquo;About 1820 there lived a Farrier of the name of Keane in the
village of Longformacus in Lammermoor.&nbsp; He was a rough, passionate
man, much addicted to swearing.&nbsp; For many years he was farrier
to the Eagle or Spottiswood troop of Yeomanry.&nbsp; One day he went
to Greenlaw to attend the funeral of his sister, intending to be home
early in the afternoon.&nbsp; His wife and family were surprised when
he did not appear as they expected and they sat up watching for him.&nbsp;
About two o&rsquo;clock in the morning a heavy weight was heard to fall
against the door of the house, and on opening it to see what was the
matter, old Keane was discovered lying in a fainting fit on the threshold.&nbsp;
He was put to bed and means used for his recovery, but when he came
out of the fit he was raving mad and talked of such frightful things
that his family were quite terrified.&nbsp; He continued till next day
in the same state, but at length his senses returned and he desired
to see the minister alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a long conversation with him he called all his family
round his bed, and required from each of his children and his wife a
solemn promise that they would none of them ever pass over a particular
spot in the moor between Longformacus and Greenlaw, known by the name
of &lsquo;The Foul Fords&rsquo; (it is the ford over a little water-course
just east of Castle Shields).&nbsp; He assigned no reason to them for
this demand, but the promise was given and he spoke no more, and died
that evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten years after his death, his eldest son Henry Keane
had to go to Greenlaw on business, and in the afternoon he prepared
to return home.&nbsp; The last person who saw him as he was leaving
the town was the blacksmith of Spottiswood, John Michie.&nbsp; He tried
to persuade Michie to accompany him home, which he refused to do as
it would take him several miles out of his way.&nbsp; Keane begged him
most earnestly to go with him as he said he <i>must</i> pass the Foul
Fords that night, and he would rather go through hell-fire than do so.&nbsp;
Michie asked him why he said he <i>must</i> pass the Foul Fords, as
by going a few yards on either side of them he might avoid them entirely.&nbsp;
He persisted that he <i>must</i> pass them and Michie at last left him,
a good deal surprised that he should talk of going over the Foul Fords
when every one knew that he and his whole family were bound, by a promise
to their dead father, never to go by the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning a labouring man from Castle Shields, by name
Adam Redpath, was going to his work (digging sheep-drains on the moor),
when on the Foul Fords he met Henry Keane lying stone dead and with
no mark of violence on his body.&nbsp; His hat, coat, waistcoat, shoes
and stockings were lying at about 100 yards distance from him on the
Greenlaw side of the Fords, and while his flannel drawers were off and
lying with the rest of his clothes, his trousers were on.&nbsp; Mr.
Ord, the minister of Longformacus, told one or two persons what John
Keane (the father) had said to him on his deathbed, and by degrees the
story got abroad.&nbsp; It was this.&nbsp; Keane said that he was returning
home slowly after his sister&rsquo;s funeral, looking on the ground,
when he was suddenly roused by hearing the tramping of horses, and on
looking up he saw a large troop of riders coming towards him two and
two.&nbsp; What was his horror when he saw that one of the two foremost
was the sister whom he had that day seen buried at Greenlaw!&nbsp; On
looking further he saw many relations and friends long before dead;
but when the two last horses came up to him he saw that one was mounted
by a dark man whose face he had never seen before.&nbsp; He led the
other horse, which, though saddled and bridled, was riderless, and on
this horse the whole company wanted to compel Keane to get.&nbsp; He
struggled violently, he said, for some time, and at last got off by
promising that one of his family should go instead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There still lives at Longformacus his remaining son Robert;
he has the same horror of the Foul Fords that his brother had, and will
not speak, nor allow any one to speak to him on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three or four years ago a herd of the name of Burton was found
dead within a short distance of the spot, without any apparent cause
for his death.&rdquo; <a name="citation272"></a><a href="#footnote272">{272}</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
The Marvels at Fr&oacute;d&aacute;</h2>
<p>The following tale has all the direct simplicity and truth to human
nature which mark the ancient literature of Iceland.&nbsp; Defoe might
have envied the profusion of detail; &ldquo;The large chest with a lock,
and the small box,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; Some of the minor portents,
such as the disturbances among inanimate objects, and the appearance
of a glow of mysterious light, &ldquo;the Fate Moon,&rdquo; recur in
modern tales of haunted houses.&nbsp; The combination of Christian exorcism,
then a novelty in Iceland, with legal proceedings against the ghosts,
is especially characteristic.</p>
<h3>THE MARVELS AT FR&Oacute;D&Aacute; <a name="citation273"></a><a href="#footnote273">{273}</a></h3>
<p>During that summer in which Christianity was adopted by law in Iceland
(1000 A.D.), it happened that a ship came to land at Snowfell Ness.&nbsp;
It was a Dublin vessel, manned by Irish and Hebrideans, with few Norsemen
on board.&nbsp; They lay there for a long time during the summer, waiting
for a favourable wind to sail into the firth, and many people from the
Ness went down to trade with them.&nbsp; There was on board a Hebridean
woman named Thorgunna, of whom her shipmates said that she owned some
costly things, the like of which would be difficult to find in Iceland.&nbsp;
When Thurid, the housewife at Fr&oacute;d&aacute;, heard of this she
was very curious to see the articles, for she was a woman that was fond
of show and finery.&nbsp; She went to the ship and asked Thorgunna whether
she had any woman&rsquo;s apparel that was finer than the common.&nbsp;
Thorgunna said that she had nothing of the kind to sell, but had some
good things of her own, that she might not be affronted at feasts or
other gatherings.&nbsp; Thurid begged a sight of these, and Thorgunna
showed her treasures.&nbsp; Thurid was much pleased with them, and thought
them very becoming, though not of high value.&nbsp; She offered to buy
them, but Thorgunna would not sell.&nbsp; Thurid then invited her to
come and stay with her, because she knew that Thorgunna was well provided,
and thought that she would get the things from her in course of time.</p>
<p>Thorgunna answered, &ldquo;I am well pleased to go to stay with you,
but you must know that I have little mind to pay for myself, because
I am well able to work, and have no dislike to it, though I will not
do any dirty work.&nbsp; I must be allowed to settle what I shall pay
for myself out of such property as I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Thorgunna spoke in this fashion, yet Thurid would have her
to go with her, and her things were taken out of the ship; these were
in a large chest with a lock and a small box, and both were taken home
to Fr&oacute;d&aacute;.&nbsp; When Thorgunna arrived there she asked
for her bed to be shown her, and was given one in the inner part of
the hall.&nbsp; Then she opened up the chest, and took bed-clothes out
of it: they were all very beautiful, and over the bed she spread English
coverlets and a silken quilt.&nbsp; Out of the chest she also brought
a bed-curtain and all the hangings that belonged to it, and the whole
outfit was so fine that folk thought they had never seen the like of
it.</p>
<p>Then said Thurid the housewife: &ldquo;Name the price of all your
bed-clothes and hangings&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thorgunna answered, &ldquo;I will not lie among straw for you, although
you are so stately, and bear yourself so proudly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thurid was ill pleased at this, and offered no more to buy the things.</p>
<p>Thorgunna worked at cloth-making every day when there was no hay-making,
but when the weather was dry she worked among the dry hay in the home
field, and had a rake made for herself which she alone was to use.&nbsp;
Thorgunna was a big woman, both broad and tall, and very stout; she
had dark eyebrows, and her eyes were close set; her hair brown and in
great abundance.&nbsp; She was well-mannered in her daily life, and
went to church every day before beginning her work, but she was not
of a light disposition nor of many words.&nbsp; Most people thought
that Thorgunna must be in the sixties, yet she was a very active woman.</p>
<p>At this time one Thorir &ldquo;wooden-leg&rdquo; and his wife Thorgrima
&ldquo;charm-cheek&rdquo; were being maintained at Fr&oacute;d&aacute;,
and there was little love between them and Thorgunna.&nbsp; The person
that she had most ado with was Kjartan, the son of the house; him she
loved much, but he was rather cold towards her, and this often vexed
her.&nbsp; Kjartan was then fifteen years old, and was both big of body
and manly in appearance.</p>
<p>The summer that year was very wet, but in the autumn there came dry
days.&nbsp; By this time the hay-work at Fr&oacute;d&aacute; was so
far advanced that all the home field was mown, and nearly the half of
it was quite dry.&nbsp; There came then a fine dry day, clear and bright,
with not a cloud to be seen in all the sky.&nbsp; Thorodd, the yeoman,
rose early in the morning and arranged the work of each one; some began
to cart off the hay, and some to put it into stalks, while the women
were set to toss and dry it.&nbsp; Thorgunna also had her share assigned
to her, and the work went on well during the day.&nbsp; When it drew
near to three in the afternoon, a mass of dark clouds was seen rising
in the north which came rapidly across the sky and took its course right
above the farm.&nbsp; They thought it certain that there was rain in
the cloud and Thorodd bade his people rake the hay together; but Thorgunna
continued to scatter hers, in spite of the orders that were given.&nbsp;
The clouds came on quickly, and when they were above the homestead at
Fr&oacute;d&aacute; there came such darkness with them that the people
could see nothing beyond the home field; indeed, they could scarcely
distinguish their own hands.&nbsp; Out of the cloud came so much rain
that all the hay which was lying flat was quite soaked.&nbsp; When the
cloud had passed over and the sky cleared again, it was seen that blood
had fallen amid the rain.&nbsp; In the evening there was a good draught,
and the blood soon dried off all the hay except that which Thorgunna
had been working at; it did not dry, nor did the rake that she had been
using.</p>
<p>Thurid asked Thorgunna what she supposed this marvel might portend.&nbsp;
She said that she did not know, &ldquo;but it seems to me most likely
that it is an evil omen for some person who is present here&rdquo;.&nbsp;
In the evening Thorgunna went home and took off her clothes, which had
been stained with the blood; then she lay down in her bed and breathed
heavily, and it was found that she was taken with sickness.&nbsp; The
shower had not fallen anywhere else than at Fr&oacute;d&aacute;.</p>
<p>All that evening Thorgunna would taste no food.&nbsp; In the morning
Thorodd came to her and asked about her sickness, and what end she thought
it would have.&nbsp; She answered that she did not expect to have any
more illnesses.&nbsp; Then she said: &ldquo;I consider you the wisest
person in the homestead here, and so I shall tell you what arrangements
I wish to make about the property that I leave behind me, and about
myself, for things will go as I tell you, though you think there is
nothing very remarkable about me.&nbsp; It will do you little good to
depart from my instructions, for this affair has so begun that it will
not pass smoothly off, unless strong measures are taken in dealing with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorodd answered: &ldquo;There seems to me great likelihood that
your forebodings will come true; and therefore,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
shall promise to you not to depart from your instructions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are my arrangements,&rdquo; said Thorgunna, &ldquo;that
I will have myself taken to Sk&aacute;lholt if I die of this sickness,
for my mind forbodes me that that place will some time or other be the
most glorious spot in this land.&nbsp; I know also that by now there
are priests there to sing the funeral service over me.&nbsp; So I ask
you to have me carried thither, and for that you shall take so much
of my property that you suffer no loss in the matter.&nbsp; Of my other
effects, Thurid shall have the scarlet cloak that I own, and I give
it her so that she may readily consent to my disposing of all the rest
as I please.&nbsp; I have a gold ring, and it shall go to the church
with me; but as for my bed and bed-hangings, I will have them burned
with fire, because they will be of service to no one.&nbsp; I do not
say this because I grudge that any one should possess these treasures,
if I knew that they would be of use to them; rather am I so earnest
in the matter, because I should be sorry for folk to fall into such
trouble for me, as I know will be the case if my words are not heeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorodd promised to do as she asked him, and after this Thorgunna&rsquo;s
sickness increased, so that she lay but few days before she died.&nbsp;
The body was first taken to the church, and Thorodd had a coffin made
for it.&nbsp; On the following day Thorodd had all the bed-clothes carried
out into the open air, and made a pile of wood beside them.&nbsp; Then
Thurid the housewife came up, and asked what he was going to do with
the bed-clothes.&nbsp; He answered that he was to burn them with fire,
as Thorgunna had directed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not have such treasures
burned,&rdquo; said Thurid.&nbsp; Thorodd answered: &ldquo;She declared
strongly that it would not do to depart from what she said&rdquo;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was mere jealousy,&rdquo; said Thurid; &ldquo;she grudged
any other person the use of them, and that was why she gave these orders;
but nothing terrible will happen though her words are set aside.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I doubt,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whether it will be well to do
otherwise than as she charged me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Thurid laid her arms round his neck, and besought him not to
burn the furnishings of the bed, and so much did she press him in this
that his heart gave way to her, and she managed it so that Thorodd burned
the mattresses and pillows, while she took for herself the quilt and
coverlets and all the hangings.&nbsp; Yet neither of them was well pleased.</p>
<p>After this the funeral was made ready; trustworthy men were sent
with the body, and good horses which Thorodd owned.&nbsp; The body was
wrapped in linen, but not sewed up in it, and then laid in the coffin.&nbsp;
After this they held south over the heath as the paths go, and went
on until they came to a farm called Lower Ness, which lies in the Tongues
of Staf-holt.&nbsp; There they asked leave to stay over night, but the
farmer would give them no hospitality.&nbsp; However, as it was close
on nightfall, they did not see how they could go on, for they thought
it would be dangerous to deal with the White River by night.&nbsp; They
therefore unloaded their horses, and carried the body into an out-house,
after which they went into the sitting-room and took off their outer
clothes, intending to stay there over night without food.</p>
<p>The people of the house were going to bed by daylight, and after
they were in bed a great noise was heard in the kitchen.&nbsp; Some
went to see whether thieves had not broken in, and when they reached
the kitchen they saw there a tall woman.&nbsp; She was quite naked,
with no clothes whatever upon her, and was busy preparing food.&nbsp;
Those who saw her were so terrified that they dared not go near her
at all.&nbsp; When the funeral party heard of this they went thither,
and saw what the matter was&mdash;Thorgunna had come there, and it seemed
advisable to them all not to meddle with her.&nbsp; When she had done
all that she wanted, she brought the food into the room, set the tables
and laid the food upon them.&nbsp; Then the funeral party said to the
farmer: &ldquo;It may happen in the end, before we part, that you will
think it dearly bought that you would show us no hospitality&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Both the farmer and the housewife answered: &ldquo;We will willingly
give you food, and do you all other services that you require&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As soon as the farmer had offered them this, Thorgunna passed out
of the room into the kitchen, and then went outside, nor did she show
herself again.&nbsp; Then a light was kindled in the room, and the wet
clothes of the guests were taken off, and dry ones given them in their
place.&nbsp; After this they sat down at table, and blessed their food,
while the farmer had holy water sprinkled over all the house.&nbsp;
The guests ate their food, and it harmed no man, although Thorgunna
had prepared it.&nbsp; They slept there that night, and were treated
with great hospitality.</p>
<p>In the morning they continued their journey, and things went very
smoothly with them; wherever this affair was heard of, most people thought
it best to do them all the service that they required, and of their
journey no more is to be told.&nbsp; When they came to Sk&aacute;lholt,
they handed over the precious things which Thorgunna had sent thither:
the ring and other articles, all of which the priests gladly received.&nbsp;
Thorgunna was buried there, while the funeral party returned home, which
they all reached in safety.</p>
<p>At Fr&oacute;d&aacute; there was a large hall with a fireplace in
the midde, and a bed-closet at the inner end of it, as was then the
custom.&nbsp; At the outer end were two store-closets, one on each side;
dried fish were piled in one of these, and there was meal in the other.&nbsp;
In this hall fires were kindled every evening, as was the custom, and
folk sat round these fires for a long while before they went to supper.&nbsp;
On that evening on which the funeral party came home, while the folk
at Fr&oacute;d&aacute; were sitting round the fires, they saw a half-moon
appear on the panelling of the hall, and it was visible to all those
who were present.&nbsp; It went round the room backwards and against
the sun&rsquo;s course, nor did it disappear so long as they sat by
the fires.&nbsp; Thorodd asked Thorir Wooden-leg what this might portend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is the Moon of Fate,&rdquo; said Thorir, &ldquo;and deaths
will come after it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This went on all that week that the
Fate-Moon came in every evening.</p>
<p>The next tidings that happened at Fr&oacute;d&aacute; were that the
shepherd came in and was very silent; he spoke little, and that in a
frenzied manner.&nbsp; Folk were most inclined to believe that he had
been bewitched, because he went about by himself, and talked to himself.&nbsp;
This went on for some time, but one evening, when two weeks of winter
had passed, the shepherd came home, went to his bed, and lay down there.&nbsp;
When they went to him in the morning he was dead, and was buried at
the church.</p>
<p>Soon after this there began great hauntings.&nbsp; One night Thorir
Wooden-leg went outside and was at some distance from the door.&nbsp;
When he was about to go in again, he saw that the shepherd had come
between him and the door.&nbsp; Thorir tried to get in, but the shepherd
would not allow him.&nbsp; Then Thorir tried to get away from him, but
the shepherd followed him, caught hold of him, and threw him down at
the door.&nbsp; He received great hurt from this, but was able to reach
his bed; there he turned black as coal, took sickness and died.&nbsp;
He was also buried at the church there, and after this both the shepherd
and Thorir were seen in company, at which all the folk became full of
fear, as was to be expected.</p>
<p>This also followed upon the burial of Thorir, that one of Thorodd&rsquo;s
men grew ill, and lay three nights before he died; then one died after
another, until six of them were gone.&nbsp; By this time the Christmas
fast had come, although the fast was not then kept in Iceland.&nbsp;
The store-closet, in which the dried fish were kept, was packed so full
that the door could not be opened; the pile reached nigh up to the rafters,
and a ladder was required to get the fish off the top of it.&nbsp; One
evening while the folk were sitting round the fires, the fish were torn,
but when search was made no living thing could be found there.</p>
<p>During the winter, a little before Christmas, Thorodd went out to
Ness for the fish he had there; there were six men in all in a ten-oared
boat, and they stayed out there all night.&nbsp; The same evening that
Thorodd went from home, it happened at Fr&oacute;d&aacute;, when folk
went to sit by the fires that had been made, that they saw a seal&rsquo;s
head rise up out of the fireplace.&nbsp; A maid-servant was the first
who came forward and saw this marvel; she took a washing-bat which lay
beside the door, and struck the seal&rsquo;s head with this, but it
rose up at the blow and gazed at Thorgunna&rsquo;s bed-hangings.&nbsp;
Then one of the men went up and beat the seal, but it rose higher at
every blow until it had come up above the fins; then the man fell into
a swoon, and all those who were present were filled with fear.&nbsp;
Then the lad Kjartan sprang forward, took up a large iron sledge-hammer
and struck at the seal&rsquo;s head; it was a heavy blow, but it only
shook its head, and looked round.&nbsp; Then Kjartan gave it stroke
after stroke, and the seal went down as though he were driving in a
stake.&nbsp; Kjartan hammered away till the seal went down so far that
he beat the floor close again above its head, and during the rest of
the winter all the portents were most afraid of Kjartan.</p>
<p>Next morning, while Thorodd and the others were coming in from Ness
with the fish, they were all lost out from Enni; the boat and the fish
drove on shore there, but the bodies were never found.&nbsp; When the
news of this reached Fr&oacute;d&aacute;, Kjartan and Thurid invited
their neighbours to the funeral banquet, and the ale prepared for Christmas
was used for this purpose.&nbsp; The first evening of the feast, however,
after the folk had taken their seats, there came into the hall Thorodd
and his companions, all dripping wet.&nbsp; The folk greeted Thorodd
well, thinking this a good omen, for at that time it was firmly believed
that drowned men, who came to their own funeral feast, were well received
by R&aacute;n, the sea-goddess; and the old beliefs had as yet suffered
little, though folk were baptised and called Christians.</p>
<p>Thorodd and his fellows went right along the hall where the folk
sat, and passed into the one where the fires were, answering no man&rsquo;s
greeting.&nbsp; Those of the household who were in the hall ran out,
and Thorodd and his men sat down beside the fires, where they remained
till they had fallen into ashes; then they went away again.&nbsp; This
befel every evening while the banquet lasted, and there was much talk
about it among those who were present.&nbsp; Some thought that it would
stop when the feast was ended.&nbsp; When the banquet was over the guests
went home, leaving the place very dull and dismal.</p>
<p>On the evening after they had gone, the fires were kindled as usual,
and after they had burned up, there came in Thorodd with his company,
all of them wet.&nbsp; They sat down by the fire and began to wring
their clothes; and after they had sat down there came in Thorir Wooden-leg
and his five companions, all covered with earth.&nbsp; They shook their
clothes and scattered the earth on Thorodd and his fellows.&nbsp; The
folk of the household rushed out of the hall, as might be expected,
and all that evening they had no light nor any warmth from the fire.</p>
<p>Next evening the fires were made in the other hall, as the dead men
would be less likely to come there; but this was not so, for everything
happened just as it had done on the previous evening, and both parties
came to sit by the fires.</p>
<p>On the third evening Kjartan advised that a large fire should be
made in the hall, and a little fire in another and smaller room.&nbsp;
This was done, and things then went on in this fashion, that Thorodd
and the others sat beside the big fire, while the household contented
themselves with the little one, and this lasted right through Christmas-tide.</p>
<p>By this time there was more and more noise in the pile of fish, and
the sound of them being torn was heard both by night and day.&nbsp;
Some time after this it was necessary to take down some of the fish,
and the man who went up on the pile saw this strange thing, that up
out of the pile there came a tail, in appearance like a singed ox-tail.&nbsp;
It was black and covered with hair like a seal.&nbsp; The man laid hold
of it and pulled, and called on the others to come and help him.&nbsp;
Others then got up on the heap, both men and women, and pulled at the
tail, but all to no purpose.&nbsp; It seemed to them that the tail was
dead, but while they tugged at it, it flew out of their hands taking
the skin off the palms of those who had been holding it hardest, and
no more was ever seen of the tail.&nbsp; The fish were then taken up
and every one was found to be torn out of the skin, yet no living thing
was to be found in the pile.</p>
<p>Following upon this, Thorgrima Charm-cheek, the wife of Thorir Wooden-leg,
fell ill, and lay only a little while before she died, and the same
evening that she was buried she was seen in company with her husband
Thorir.&nbsp; The sickness then began a second time after the tail had
been seen, and now the women died more than the men.&nbsp; Another six
persons died in this attack, and some fled away on account of the ghosts
and the hauntings.&nbsp; In the autumn there had been thirty in the
household, of whom eighteen were dead, and five had run away, leaving
only seven behind in the spring.</p>
<p>When these marvels had reached this pitch, it happened one day that
Kjartan went to Helga-fell to see his uncle Snorri, and asked his advice
as to what should be done.&nbsp; There had then come to Helga-fell a
priest whom Gizurr the white had sent to Snorri, and this priest Snorri
sent to Fr&oacute;d&aacute; along with Kjartan, his son Thord, and six
other men.&nbsp; He also gave them this advice, that they should burn
all Thorgunna&rsquo;s bed-hangings and hold a law court at the door,
and there prosecute all those men who were walking after death.&nbsp;
He also bade the priest hold service there, consecrate water, and confess
the people.&nbsp; They summoned men from the nearest farms to accompany
them, and arrived at Fr&oacute;d&aacute; on the evening before Candlemas,
just at the time when the fires were being kindled.&nbsp; Thurid the
housewife had then taken the sickness after the same fashion as those
who had died.&nbsp; Kjartan went in at once, and saw that Thorodd and
the others were sitting by the fire as usual.&nbsp; He took down Thorgunna&rsquo;s
bed-hangings, went into the hall, and carried out a live coal from the
fire: then all the bed-gear that Thorgunna had owned was burned.</p>
<p>After this Kjartan summoned Thorir Wooden-leg, and Thord summoned
Thorodd, on the charge of going about the homestead without leave, and
depriving men of both health and life; all those who sat beside the
fire were summoned in the same way.&nbsp; Then a court was held at the
door, in which the charges were declared, and everything done as in
a regular law court; opinions were given, the case summed up, and judgment
passed.&nbsp; After sentence had been pronounced on Thorir Wooden-leg,
he rose up and said: &ldquo;Now we have sat as long as we can bear&rdquo;.&nbsp;
After this he went out by the other door from that at which the court
was held.&nbsp; Then sentence was passed on the shepherd, and when he
heard it he stood up and said: &ldquo;Now I shall go, and I think it
would have been better before&rdquo;.&nbsp; When Thorgrima heard sentence
pronounced on her, she rose up and said: &ldquo;Now we have stayed while
it could be borne&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then one after another was summoned,
and each stood up as judgment was given upon him; all of them said something
as they went out, and showed that they were loath to part.&nbsp; Finally
sentence was passed on Thorodd himself, and when he heard it, he rose
and said: &ldquo;Little peace I find here, and let us all flee now,&rdquo;
and went out after that.&nbsp; Then Kjartan and the others entered and
the priest carried holy water and sacred relics over all the house.&nbsp;
Later on in the day he held solemn service, and after this all the hauntings
and ghost-walkings at Fr&oacute;d&aacute; ceased, while Thurid recovered
from her sickness and became well again.</p>

Hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Pakeha Maori and &ldquo;The Leprous Hand&rdquo;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Hand of the Ghost that Bit.&rdquo;</i></p>
<h3>HANDS ALL ROUND</h3>
<p>Nothing was more common, in the <i>s&eacute;ances</i> of Home, the
&ldquo;Medium,&rdquo; than the appearance of &ldquo;Spirit hands&rdquo;.&nbsp;
If these were made of white kid gloves, stuffed, the idea, at least,
was borrowed from ghost stories, in which ghostly hands, with no visible
bodies, are not unusual.&nbsp; We see them in the Shchapoff case, at
Rerrick, and in other haunted houses.&nbsp; Here are some tales of Hands,
old or new.</p>
<h3>THE COLD HAND</h3>
<p>[Jerome Cardan, the famous physician, tells the following anecdote
in his <i>De Rerum Varietate</i>, lib. x., 93.&nbsp; Jerome only once
heard a rapping himself, at the time of the death of a friend at a distance.&nbsp;
He was in a terrible fright, and dared not leave his room all day.]</p>
<p>A story which my father used often to tell: &ldquo;I was brought
up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the house of Joannes Resta, and therein
taught Latin to his three sons; when I left them I supported myself
on my own means.&nbsp; It chanced that one of these lads, while I was
studying medicine, fell deadly sick, he being now a young man grown,
and I was called in to be with the youth, partly for my knowledge of
medicine, partly for old friendship&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; The master of
the house happened to be absent; the patient slept in an upper chamber,
one of his brothers and I in a lower room, the third brother, Isidore,
was not at home.&nbsp; Each of the rooms was next to a turret; turrets
being common in that city.&nbsp; When we went to bed on the first night
of my visit, I heard a constant knocking on the wall of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, it is only a familiar spirit,&rsquo;
said my companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;They call them <i>follets</i>; it is
harmless enough, and seldom so troublesome as it is now: I don&rsquo;t
know what can be the matter with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young fellow went to sleep, but I was kept awake for a
while, wondering and observing.&nbsp; After half an hour of stillness
I felt a thumb press on my head, and a sense of cold.&nbsp; I kept watching;
the forefinger, the middle finger, and the rest of the hand were next
laid on, the little finger nearly reaching my forehead.&nbsp; The hand
was like that of a boy of ten, to guess by the size, and so cold that
it was extremely unpleasant.&nbsp; Meantime I was chuckling over my
luck in such an opportunity of witnessing a wonder, and I listened eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hand stole with the ring finger foremost over my face
and down my nose, it was slipping into my mouth, and two finger-tips
had entered, when I threw it off with my right hand, thinking it was
uncanny, and not relishing it inside my body.&nbsp; Silence followed
and I lay awake, distrusting the spectre more or less.&nbsp; In about
half an hour it returned and repeated its former conduct, touching me
very lightly, yet very chilly.&nbsp; When it reached my mouth I again
drove it away.&nbsp; Though my lips were tightly closed, I felt an extreme
icy cold in my teeth.&nbsp; I now got out of bed, thinking this might
be a friendly visit from the ghost of the sick lad upstairs, who must
have died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I went to the door, the thing passed before me, rapping
on the walls.&nbsp; When I was got to the door it knocked outside; when
I opened the door, it began to knock on the turret.&nbsp; The moon was
shining; I went on to see what would happen, but it beat on the other
sides of the tower, and, as it always evaded me, I went up to see how
my patient was.&nbsp; He was alive, but very weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was speaking to those who stood about his bed, we heard
a noise as if the house was falling.&nbsp; In rushed my bedfellow, the
brother of the sick lad, half dead with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When you got up,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I felt a cold
hand on my back.&nbsp; I thought it was you who wanted to waken me and
take me to see my brother, so I pretended to be asleep and lay quiet,
supposing that you would go alone when you found me so sound asleep.&nbsp;
But when I did not feel you get up, and the cold hand grew to be more
than I could bear, I hit out to push your hand away, and felt your place
empty&mdash;but warm.&nbsp; Then I remembered the <i>follet</i>, and
ran upstairs as hard as I could put my feet to the ground: never was
I in such a fright!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sick lad died on the following night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Carden the elder stopped, and Jerome, his son, philosophised
on the subject.</p>
<p>Miss Dendy, on the authority of Mr. Elijah Cope, an itinerant preacher,
gives this anecdote of similar familiarity with a <i>follet</i> in Staffordshire.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairies!&nbsp; I went into a farmhouse to stay a night, and
in the evening there came a knocking in the room as if some one had
struck the table.&nbsp; I jumped up.&nbsp; My hostess got up and &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo;
says she, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off&rsquo;.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what was it?&rsquo;
says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just a poor old fairy,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;Old
Nancy.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a poor old thing; been here ever so long; lost
her husband and her children; it&rsquo;s bad to be left like that, all
alone.&nbsp; I leave a bit o&rsquo; cake on the table for her, and sometimes
she fetches it, and sometimes she don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE BLACK DOG AND THE THUMBLESS HAND</h3>
<p>[Some years ago I published in a volume of tales called <i>The Wrong
Paradise</i>, a paper styled &ldquo;My Friend the Beach-comber&rdquo;.&nbsp;
This contained genuine adventures of a kinsman, my oldest and most intimate
friend, who has passed much of his life in the Pacific, mainly in a
foreign colony, and in the wild New Hebrides.&nbsp; My friend is a man
of education, an artist, and a student of anthropology and ethnology.&nbsp;
Engaged on a work of scientific research, he has not committed any of
his innumerable adventures, warlike or wandering, to print.&nbsp; The
following &ldquo;yarn&rdquo; he sent to me lately, in a letter on some
points of native customs.&nbsp; Of course the description of the Beach-comber,
in the book referred to, is purely fictitious.&nbsp; The yarn of &ldquo;The
Thumbless Hand&rdquo; is here cast in a dialogue, but the whole of the
strange experience described is given in the words of the narrator.&nbsp;
It should be added that, though my friend was present at some amateur
<i>s&eacute;ances</i>, in a remote isle of the sea, he is not a spiritualist,
never was one, and has no theory to account for what occurred, and no
belief in &ldquo;spooks&rdquo; of any description.&nbsp; His faith is
plighted to the theories of Mr. Darwin, and that is his only superstition.&nbsp;
The name of the principal character in the yarn is, of course, fictitious.&nbsp;
The real name is an old but not a noble one in England.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the natives the custom of walking through fire?&rdquo;
said my friend the Beach-comber, in answer to a question of mine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not that I know of.&nbsp; In fact the soles of their feet are
so thick-skinned that they would think nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then have they any spiritualistic games, like the Burmans
and Maories?&nbsp; I have a lot of yarns about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are too jolly well frightened of bush spirits to invite
them to tea,&rdquo; said the Beach-comber.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew a fellow
who got a bit of land merely by whistling up and down in it at nightfall.
<a name="citation292"></a><a href="#footnote292">{292}</a>&nbsp; They
think spirits whistle.&nbsp; No, I don&rsquo;t fancy they go in for
<i>s&eacute;ances</i>.&nbsp; But we once had some, we white men, in
one of the islands.&nbsp; Not the Oui-ouis&rdquo; (native name for the
French), &ldquo;real white men.&nbsp; And that led to Bolter&rsquo;s
row with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about his young woman.&nbsp; I told her the story; it
was thoughtless, and yet I don&rsquo;t know that I was wrong.&nbsp;
After all, Bolter could not have been a comfortable fellow to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this opinion readers of the Beach-comber&rsquo;s narrative will
probably agree, I fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad moral character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&nbsp; Queer fish; kept queer company.&nbsp;
Even if she was ever so fond of dogs, I don&rsquo;t think a girl would
have cared for Bolter&rsquo;s kennel.&nbsp; Not in her bedroom anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she could surely have got him to keep them outside, however
doggy he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not doggy a bit.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that Bolter
ever saw the black dogs himself.&nbsp; He certainly never told me so.&nbsp;
It is that beastly Thumbless Hand, no woman could have stood it, not
to mention the chance of catching cold when it pulled the blankets off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you talking about?&nbsp; I can understand
a man attended by black dogs that nobody sees but himself.&nbsp; The
Catholics tell it of John Knox, and of another Reformer, a fellow called
Smeaton.&nbsp; Moreover, it is common in delirium tremens.&nbsp; But
you say Bolter didn&rsquo;t see the dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not so far as he told me, but I did, and other fellows,
when with Bolter.&nbsp; Bolter was asleep; he didn&rsquo;t see anything.&nbsp;
Also the Hand, which was a good deal worse.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
if he ever saw it.&nbsp; But he was jolly nervous, and he had heard
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The habits of the Beach-comber are absolutely temperate, otherwise
my astonishment would have been less, and I should have regarded all
these phenomena as subjective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it all, old cock,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I told you last time I was at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never; my memory for yarns is only too good.&nbsp; I hate
a chestnut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes!&nbsp; Mind you I don&rsquo;t profess to explain
the thing; only I don&rsquo;t think I did wrong in telling the young
woman, for, however you account for it, it was not nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good many years ago there came to the island, as a clerk,
<i>un nomm&eacute;</i> Bolter, English or Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is not Jewish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I really don&rsquo;t know about his breed.&nbsp; The
most curious thing about his appearance was his eyes: they were large,
black, and had a peculiar dull dead lustre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they shine in the dark?&nbsp; I knew a fellow at Oxford
whose eyes did.&nbsp; Chairs ran after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never noticed; I don&rsquo;t remember.&nbsp; &lsquo;Psychically,&rsquo;
as you superstitious muffs call it, Bolter was still more queer.&nbsp;
At that time we were all gone on spirit-rapping.&nbsp; Bolter turned
out a great acquisition, &lsquo;medium,&rsquo; or what not.&nbsp; Mind
you, I&rsquo;m not saying Bolter was straight.&nbsp; In the dark he&rsquo;d
tell you what you had in your hand, exact time of your watch, and so
on.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t take stock in this, and one night brought some
photographs with me, and asked for a description of them.&nbsp; This
he gave correctly, winding up by saying, &lsquo;The one nearest your
body is that of ---&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here my friend named a person well known to both of us, whose name
I prefer not to introduce here.&nbsp; This person, I may add, had never
been in or near the island, and was totally unknown to Bolter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; my friend went on, &ldquo;the photographs
were all the time inside my pocket.&nbsp; Now, really, Bolter had some
mystic power of seeing in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hyper&aelig;sthesia!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hypercriticism!&rdquo; said the Beach-comber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened next <i>might</i> be hyper&aelig;sthesia&mdash;I
suppose you mean abnormal intensity of the senses&mdash;but how could
hyper&aelig;sthesia see through a tweed coat and lining?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what happened next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolter&rsquo;s firm used to get sheep by every mail from ---,
and send them regularly to their station, six miles off.&nbsp; One time
they landed late in the afternoon, and yet were foolishly sent off,
Bolter in charge.&nbsp; I said at the time he would lose half the lot,
as it would be dark long before he could reach the station.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t lose them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day I met one of the niggers who was sent to lend him
a hand, and asked results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Master,&rsquo; said the nigger, &lsquo;Bolter is a
devil!&nbsp; He sees at night.&nbsp; When the sheep ran away to right
or left in the dark, he told us where to follow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>heard</i> them, I suppose,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but you must be sharp to have sharper senses than these
niggers.&nbsp; Anyhow, that was not Bolter&rsquo;s account of it.&nbsp;
When I saw him and spoke to him he said simply, &lsquo;Yes, that when
excited or interested to seek or find anything in obscurity the object
became covered with a dim glow of light, which rendered it visible&rsquo;.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But things in a pocket.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That also,&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Curious isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Probably the R&ouml;ntgen
rays are implicated therein, eh?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever read Dr. Gregory&rsquo;s <i>Letters on Animal
Magnetism</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cove that invented Gregory&rsquo;s Mixture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beast he must have been.&nbsp; No, I never read him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that Major Buckley&rsquo;s hypnotised subjects saw
hidden objects in a blue light&mdash;mottoes inside a nut, for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;R&ouml;ntgen rays, for a fiver!&nbsp; But Bolter said nothing
about seeing <i>blue</i> light.&nbsp; Well, after three or four <i>s&eacute;ances</i>
Bolter used to be very nervous and unwilling to sleep alone, so I once
went with him to his one-roomed hut.&nbsp; We turned into the same bed.&nbsp;
I was awakened later by a noise and movement in the room.&nbsp; Found
the door open; the full moon streaming in, making light like day, and
the place full of great big black dogs&mdash;well, anyhow there were
four or five!&nbsp; They were romping about, seemingly playing.&nbsp;
One jumped on the bed, another rubbed his muzzle on mine! (the bed was
low, and I slept outside).&nbsp; Now I never had anything but love for
dogs of any kind, and as&mdash;<i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas</i>?&mdash;love
casts out fear, I simply got up, turned them all out, shut the door,
and turned in again myself.&nbsp; Of course my idea was that they were
flesh and blood, and I allude to physical fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slept, but was anew awakened by a ghastly feeling that the
blanket was being dragged and creeping off the bed.&nbsp; I pulled it
up again, but anew began the slow movement of descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather surprised, I pulled it up afresh and held it, and must
have dozed off, as I suppose.&nbsp; Awoke, to feel it being pulled again;
it was slipping, slipping, and then with a sudden, violent jerk it was
thrown on the floor.&nbsp; <i>Il faut dire</i> that during all this
I had glanced several times at Bolter, who seemed profoundly asleep.&nbsp;
But now alarmed I tried to wake him.&nbsp; In vain, he slept like the
dead; his face, always a pasty white, now like marble in the moonlight.&nbsp;
After some hesitation I put the blanket back on the bed and held it
fast.&nbsp; The pulling at once began and increased in strength, and
I, by this time thoroughly alarmed, put all my strength against it,
and hung on like grim death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get a better hold I had taken a turn over my head (or perhaps
simply to hide), when suddenly I felt a pressure outside on my body,
and a movement like fingers&mdash;they gradually approached my head.&nbsp;
Mad with fear I chucked off the blanket, grasped a Hand, gazed on it
for one moment in silent horror, and threw it away!&nbsp; No wonder,
it was attached to no arm or body, it was hairy and dark coloured, the
fingers were short, blunt, with long, claw-like nails, and it was minus
a thumb!&nbsp; Too frightened to get up I had to stop in bed, and, I
suppose, fell to sleep again, after fresh vain attempts to awaken Bolter.&nbsp;
Next morning I told him about it.&nbsp; He said several men who had
thus passed the night with him had seen this hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo;
added he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s lucky you didn&rsquo;t have the big black
dogs also.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Tableau</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was to have slept again with him next night to look further
into the matter, but a friend of his came from --- that day, so I could
not renew the experiment, as I had fully determined to do.&nbsp; By-the-bye,
I was troubled for months after by the same feeling that the clothes
were being pulled off the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the yarn of the Black Dogs and the Thumbless
Hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you did no harm in telling
Bolter&rsquo;s young woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it when I told her, or of her interest
in the kennel; but, by George, she soon broke off her engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know Manning, the Pakeha Maori, the fellow who wrote
<i>Old New Zealand</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, what about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not put it in his book, but he told the same yarn,
without the dogs, as having happened to himself.&nbsp; He saw the whole
arm, and <i>the hand was leprous</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said the Beach-comber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning he was obliged to view the body of an old Maori,
who had been murdered in his garden the night before.&nbsp; That old
man&rsquo;s hand was the hand he saw.&nbsp; I know a room in an old
house in England where plucking off the bed-clothes goes on, every now
and then, and has gone on as long as the present occupants have been
there.&nbsp; But I only heard lately, and <i>they</i> only heard from
me, that the same thing used to occur, in the same room and no other,
in the last generation, when another family lived there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only footsteps are heard creeping up, before the twitches
come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do the people do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&nbsp; We set a camera once to photograph the spook.&nbsp;
He did not sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rum!&rdquo; said the Beach-comber.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
mind you, as to spooks, I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.&rdquo; <a name="citation299"></a><a href="#footnote299">{299}</a></p>
<h3>THE GHOST THAT BIT</h3>
<p>The idiot Scotch laird in the story would not let the dentist put
his fingers into his mouth, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m feared ye&rsquo;ll
bite me&rdquo;.&nbsp; The following anecdote proves that a ghost may
entertain a better founded alarm on this score.&nbsp; A correspondent
of <i>Notes and Queries</i> (3rd Sept., 1864) is responsible for the
narrative, given &ldquo;almost <i>verbatim</i> from the lips of the
lady herself,&rdquo; a person of tried veracity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emma S---, one of seven children, was sleeping alone, with
her face towards the west, at a large house near C---, in the Staffordshire
moorlands.&nbsp; As she had given orders to her maid to call her at
an early hour, she was not surprised at being awakened between three
and four on a fine August morning in 1840 by a sharp tapping at her
door, when in spite of a &ldquo;thank you, I hear,&rdquo; to the first
and second raps, with the third came a rush of wind, which caused the
curtains to be drawn up in the centre of the bed.&nbsp; She became annoyed,
and sitting up called out, &ldquo;Marie, what are you about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, however, of her servant, she was astonished to see the face
of an aunt by marriage peering above and between the curtains, and at
the same moment&mdash;whether unconsciously she threw forward her arms,
or whether they were drawn forward, as it were, in a vortex of air,
she cannot be sure&mdash;one of her thumbs was sensibly pressed between
the teeth of the apparition, though no mark afterwards remained on it.&nbsp;
All this notwithstanding, she remained collected and unalarmed; but
instantly arose, dressed, and went downstairs, where she found not a
creature stirring.&nbsp; Her father, on coming down shortly afterwards,
naturally asked what had made her rise so early; rallied her on the
cause, and soon afterwards went on to his sister-in-law&rsquo;s house,
where he found that she had just unexpectedly died.&nbsp; Coming back
again, and not noticing his daughter&rsquo;s presence in the room, in
consequence of her being behind a screen near the fire, he suddenly
announced the event to his wife, as being of so remarkable a character
that he could in no way account for it.&nbsp; As may be anticipated,
Emma, overhearing this unlooked-for <i>denouement</i> of her dream,
at once fell to the ground in a fainting condition.</p>
<p><i>On one of the thumbs of the corpse was found a mark as if it had
been bitten in the death agony</i>. <a name="citation300"></a><a href="#footnote300">{300}</a></p>
<p>We have now followed the &ldquo;ghostly&rdquo; from its germs in
dreams, and momentary hallucinations of eye or ear, up to the most prodigious
narratives which popular invention has built on bases probably very
slight.&nbsp; Where facts and experience, whether real or hallucinatory
experience, end, where the mythop&oelig;ic fancy comes in, readers may
decide for themselves.</p>

This child had a more curious experience.&nbsp; Her nurse was very ill,
and of course did not sleep in the nursery.&nbsp; One morning the little
girl said, &ldquo;Macpherson is better, I saw her come in last night
with a candle in her hand.&nbsp; She just stooped over me and then went
to Tom&rdquo; (a younger brother) &ldquo;and kissed him in his sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Macpherson had died in the night, and her attendants, of course, protested
ignorance of her having left her deathbed.</p>

<p><a name="footnote28"></a><a href="#citation28">{28}</a>&nbsp; What
is now called &ldquo;mental telegraphy&rdquo; or &ldquo;telepathy&rdquo;
is quite an old idea.&nbsp; Bacon calls it &ldquo;sympathy&rdquo; between
two distant minds, sympathy so strong that one communicates with the
other without using the recognised channels of the senses.&nbsp; Izaak
Walton explains in the same way Dr. Donne&rsquo;s vision, in Paris,
of his wife and dead child.&nbsp; &ldquo;If two lutes are strung to
an exact harmony, and one is struck, the other sounds,&rdquo; argues
Walton.&nbsp; Two minds may be as harmoniously attuned and communicate
each with each.&nbsp; Of course, in the case of the lutes there are
actual vibrations, physical facts.&nbsp; But we know nothing of vibrations
in the brain which can traverse space to another brain.</p>
<p>Many experiments have been made in consciously transferring thoughts
or emotions from one mind to another.&nbsp; These are very liable to
be vitiated by bad observation, collusion and other causes.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
intercommunication between mind and mind without the aid of the recognised
senses&mdash;a supposed process of &ldquo;telepathy&rdquo;&mdash;is
a current explanation of the dreams in which knowledge is obtained that
exists in the mind of another person, and of the delusion by virtue
of which one person sees another who is perhaps dying, or in some other
crisis, at a distance.&nbsp; The idea is popular.&nbsp; A poor Highland
woman wrote to her son in Glasgow: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be thinking too
much of us, or I shall be seeing you some evening in the byre&rdquo;.&nbsp;
This is a simple expression of the hypothesis of &ldquo;telepathy&rdquo;
or &ldquo;mental telegraphy&rdquo;.</p>

The difficulty of knowing whether one is awake or asleep, just about
the moment of entering or leaving sleep is notorious.&nbsp; The author,
on awaking in a perfectly dark room, has occasionally seen it in a dim
light, and has even been aware, or seemed to be aware, of the pattern
of the wall paper.&nbsp; In a few moments this effect of light disappears,
and all is darkness.&nbsp; This is the confused mental state technically
styled &ldquo;Borderland,&rdquo; a haunt of ghosts, who are really flitting
dreams.</p>

Besides the length of time since the murder was committed, there is
another reason why all the bones were not found, <i>viz</i>., that there
is a little burn or brook which had run for the space of twenty years,
at least, across upon the place when the bones were found, and would
have carried them all away had it not been that the bush, at the side
of which they were buried, had turned the force of the stream a little
from off that place where they lay, for they were not more than a foot,
or at most a foot and a half, under ground, and it is only within these
three years that a water-spate has altered the course of the burn.</p>

How did Inverawe get leave to wear the Highland dress?</p>
<p><a name="footnote160"></a><a href="#citation160">{160}</a>&nbsp;
In every version of the story that I have heard or read Ticonderoga
is called St. Louis, and Inverawe was ignorant of its other name.&nbsp;
Yet in all the histories of the war that I have seen, the only name
given to the place is Ticonderoga.&nbsp; There is no mention of its
having a French name.&nbsp; Even if Inverawe knew the fort they were
to storm was called Ticonderoga, he cannot have known it when the ghost
appeared to him in Scotland.&nbsp; At that time there was not even a
fort at Ticonderoga, as the French only erected it in 1756.&nbsp; Inverawe
had told his story to friends in Scotland before the war broke out in
America, so even if in 1758 he did know the real name of the fort that
the expedition was directed against, I don&rsquo;t see that it lessens
the interest of the story.&mdash;E. A. C.</p>
<p>The French really called the place Fort Carillon, which disguised
the native name Ticonderoga.&nbsp; See <i>Memoirs of the Chevalier Johnstone</i>.&mdash;A.
L.</p>
<p><a name="footnote162"></a><a href="#citation162">{162}</a>&nbsp;
Abercromby&rsquo;s force consisted of the 27th, 42nd, 44th, 46th, 55th,
and battalions of the 60th Royal Americans, with about 9000 Provincials
and a train of artillery.&nbsp; The assault, however, took place before
the guns could come up, matters having been hastened by the information
that M. de L&eacute;vy was approaching with 3000 French troops to relieve
Ticonderoga garrison.</p>

This account is abridged from Mr. Walter Leaf&rsquo;s translation of
Aksakoff&rsquo;s <i>Predvestniki Spiritizma</i>, St. Petersburg, 1895.&nbsp;
Mr. Aksakoff publishes contemporary letters, certificates from witnesses,
and Mr. Akutin&rsquo;s hostile report.&nbsp; It is based on the possibility
of imitating the raps, the difficulty of locating them, and the fact
that the flying objects were never seen to start.&nbsp; If Mrs. Shchapoff
threw them, they might, perhaps, have occasionally been seen to start.&nbsp;
<i>S.P.R</i>., vol. xii., p. 298.&nbsp; Precisely similar events occurred
in Russian military quarters in 1853.&nbsp; As a quantity of Government
property was burned, official inquiries were held.&nbsp; The reports
are published by Mr. Aksakoff.&nbsp; The repeated verdict was that no
suspicion attached to any subject of the Czar.</p>

John Wesley, however, places Hetty as next in seniority to Mary or Molly.&nbsp;
We do not certainly know whether Hetty was a child, or a grown-up girl,
but, as she always sat up till her father went to bed, the latter is
the more probable opinion.&nbsp; As Hetty has been accused of causing
the disturbances, her age is a matter of interest.&nbsp; Girls of twelve
or thirteen are usually implicated in these affairs.&nbsp; Hetty was
probably several years older.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
